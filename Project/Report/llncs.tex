\section{Introduction}
The broad area of Text Classification has been a topic of research for a very long time now, and has been well  researched especially in the case of supervised learning of classifiers. The traditional problems solved in the past by text classification include automatically cataloging news articles, web pages and spam detection in emails, etc. Text classification as defined by \cite{survey1}, is the activity of labeling natural language texts with thematic categories from a predefined set. Most of the earlier approaches assume the existence of sufficient training data, which has labeled instances of documents with their corresponding labels. As the process of labeling here requires human effort, our focus is therefore directed towards
tackling the problem of classification of limited labeled data, otherwise referred to as semi-supervised learning, assuming we have a large number of un-labeled documents. \\[10pt]

Although text classification is a problem that has been looked into right from the 1960s, email classification is highly relevant in today's fast-paced world, where one does not have the time to sift through vast amounts of mail but would rather like information clustered together, so that one may disregard the irrelevant ones such as promotional offers, and focus attention on the important ones at hand. Triaging has gained a lot of focus in recent times, with GMail launching personalized mail classification, and with other services such as Mailbox and Boxer focusing on improving user efficiency. Thus, this problem is of immense interest in recent times, and improving performance and accuracy, without existence of enough labeled email, is of prime concern. \\[10pt]

One of the most popular problems addressed by email classification is that of spam filtering, i.e. separating emails into spam and ham. This problem has been widely addressed, with various classifiers and feature selection and extraction methods experimented with. Prior work has shown great results on the Enron corpus, which is the most popular dataset used for this problem. We wish to focus on the problem of categorizing emails into categories, which would help a user identify the emails important to him. If we have a idea about the areas of interest of a user, then the emails could be easily filtered according to the category and the relevant mails can be displayed first, hence making it personalized to the user.\\[10pt]

Before we describe the exact problem we solve and our approach, a brief survey of existing techniques to solve email classification is shown in the following section.

\section{Literature Survey} 
As mentioned earlier, spam filtering was one of the popular problems addressed. Initially, the mails were classified as spam using the presence of certain predefined tokens in the email body. As these methods require manual specification of these tokens, the focus shifted to learning, which required the mails to defined as a set of features. Among the various feature extraction techniques, the Bag-of-Words feature representation has been widely used. This representation gives a set of binary features, for each mail, where each feature shows the presence or absence of a particular term.
Some of the other methods such  as \cite{junk} include other spam features, that are domain specific. Other techniques such as \cite{time} have used temporal features which identify temporal relations in an email sequence in the form of temporal sequential patterns using the timestamps. Behavioral features have also been identified by \cite{behave}, by looking at outgoing messages from a user. \\[10pt]

Once the features have been extracted from the emails, the standard supervised classification techniques have been put to use. The most predominant ones, being the Naive Bayes and the SVM classifiers. The Naive Bayes classifier assumes that each of the features  $f_1,f_2, ... f_n$ of the email are conditionally independent given the class label $C$. Surprisingly, this has proved to quite effective for email classification. Studies have been performed, comparing different classification approaches, eg: the Naive Bayes has been compared with Rule learning approaches by \cite{nbrule} and has been shown that Naive Bayes performs much better.
SVM's have also been widely used, which try to separate the two classes by an optimum hyperplane. Another comparative study by \cite{comp} showed the effectiveness of a decision tree classifier in spam filtering in comparison to SVM's and Neural Networks. \\[10pt]

The unsupervised approaches for email classification are broadly based upon 2 techniques, namely EM (Expectation Maximization) and Co-Training. These approaches typically start with a very small set of labeled instances and slowly label each of the unlabeled instances in subsequent iterations. The EM algorithm has been traditionally used to solve incomplete data problems, in many different areas. Here, the unlabeled emails constitute the incomplete data of the problem. The EM algorithm for text classification first introduced by \cite{EM} first trains a classifier with only the available labeled documents, and then uses the classifier to assign probabilistically-weighted class labels to each unlabeled document by calculating the expectation of the missing class labels.  The idea of co-training, on the other hand is different. Co-training was used in email classification first by \cite{cotrain}. It starts with just a few labeled emails, and builds an initial weak classifier. It assumes the existence of 2 sets of redundant features but sufficient on their own for correct classification. We can see that in case of email, we can think of the email body and email header (including subject) as a set of 2 independent feature sets. \cite{cotrain} have shown that SVM's have performed better than the Naive Bayes classifier when Co-training is used. \\[10pt]

Our approach draws inspiration from Co-Training and EM, and uses the Co-EM approach, which was proposed by \cite{coem}. To the best of our knowledge, Co-EM has not been experimented with, for the purpose of email classification. We use Co-EM for email classification, and compare with Co-Training and evaluate it's effectiveness.


\section{Methodology} 

Before going into the details of our approach, we provide a brief description of the Co-Training algorithm, as applied to email classification by \cite{cotrain}.


\begin{flushleft}


\textbf{Co-Training :} \\[10pt]

Given 2 redundantly sufficient sets of features $F_1$ and $F_2$, $L$ - the set of labeled mails (typically small) and $U$ - the set of unlabeled mails, the algorithm switches between 2 classifiers and add mails to $L$, in each iteration.\\[10pt]

\begin{algorithm}[H]
 \KwData{$L$,$U$,$k$ (parameter)}
 \KwResult{Fully labeled set $L$}
 
 \While{Any documents are present in U}{

  Learn classifier $C_1$ from $F_1$ on $L$\;
  Learn classifier $C_1$ from $F_2$ on $L$\;
  \For{Classifier C in $\left\lbrace C_1, C_2 \right\rbrace$ }{
	$C$ labels mails in $U$ based on it's feature set.
	
	Choose $k$ most confidently predicted mails from each class, in $U$.
	
	Remove this set of mails from $U$ and add them to $L$, with the labels predicted by $C$.
	
  }
%  \eIf{understand}{
%   go to next section\;
%   current section becomes this one\;
%   }{
%   go back to the beginning of current section\;
%  }
 }
 \caption{Co-Training}
\end{algorithm} 

	
Here, the set $F_1$ of features used are extracted from the body of the mail, and the set $F_2$ from the mail header, which includes information about the sender, receiver and the subject of the mail. As these two pieces of information are mostly disjoint, and as subject and sender may prove to be a good discriminator in classifying emails, we choose this split.


\end{flushleft}


\section{Experiments and Results} 
\section{Conclusions and Future Work}

\subsection{How to Invoke the LLNCS Document Class}
%
The LLNCS class is an extension of the standard \LaTeX{} ``article''
document class. Therefore you may use all ``article'' commands for the
body of your contribution to prepare your manuscript.
LLNCS class is invoked by replacing ``article'' by ``llncs'' in the
first line of your document:
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{llncs}
%
\begin{document}
  <Your contribution>
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}
%
\subsection{Contributions Already Coded with \protect\LaTeX{} without
the LLNCS document class}
%
If your file is already coded with \LaTeX{} you can easily
adapt it a posteriori to the LLNCS document class.

Please refrain from using any \LaTeX{} or \TeX{} commands
that affect the layout or formatting of your document (i.e. commands
like \verb|\textheight|, \verb|\vspace|, \verb|\headsep| etc.).
There may nevertheless be exceptional occasions on which to
use some of them.

The LLNCS document class has been carefully designed to produce the
right layout from your \LaTeX{} input. If there is anything specific you
would like to do and for which the style file does not provide a
command, {\em please contact us}. Same holds for any error and bug you
discover (there is however no reward for this -- sorry).
%
\section{General Rules for Coding Formulas}
%
With mathematical formulas you may proceed as described
in Sect.\,3.3 of the {\em \LaTeX{} User's Guide \& Reference
Manual\/} by Leslie Lamport (2nd~ed. 1994), Addison-Wesley Publishing
Company, Inc.

Equations are automatically numbered sequentially throughout your
contribution using arabic numerals in parentheses on the right-hand
side.

When you are working in math mode everything is typeset in italics.
Sometimes you need to insert non-mathematical elements (e.g.\
words or phrases). Such insertions should be coded in roman
(with \verb|\mbox|) as illustrated in the following example:
\begin{flushleft}
{\itshape Sample Input}
\end{flushleft}
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation}
  \left(\frac{a^{2} + b^{2}}{c^{3}} \right) = 1 \quad
  \mbox{ if } c\neq 0 \mbox{ and if } a,b,c\in \bbbr \enspace .
\end{equation}
\end{verbatim}
{\itshape Sample Output}
\begin{equation}
  \left(\frac{a^{2} + b^{2}}{c^{3}} \right) = 1 \quad
  \mbox{ if } c\neq 0 \mbox{ and if } a,b,c\in \bbbr \enspace .
\end{equation}

If you wish to start a new paragraph immediately after a displayed
equation, insert a blank line so as to produce the required
indentation. If there is no new paragraph either do not insert
a blank line or code \verb|\noindent| immediately before
continuing the text.

Please punctuate a displayed equation in the same way as other
ordinary text but with an \verb|\enspace| before end punctuation.

Note that the sizes of the parentheses or other delimiter
symbols used in equations should ideally match the height of the
formulas being enclosed. This is automatically taken care of by
the following \LaTeX{} commands:\\[2mm]
\verb|\left(| or \verb|\left[| and
\verb|\right)| or \verb|\right]|.
%
\subsection{Italic and Roman Type in Math Mode}
%
\begin{alpherate}
\item
In math mode \LaTeX{} treats all letters as though they
were mathematical or physical variables, hence they are typeset as
characters of their own in
italics. However, for certain components of formulas, like short texts,
this would be incorrect and therefore coding in roman is required.
Roman should also be used for
subscripts and superscripts {\em in formulas\/} where these are
merely labels and not in themselves variables,
e.g. $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ \emph{not} $T_{eff}$,
$T_{\mathrm K}$ \emph{not} $T_K$ (K = Kelvin),
$m_{\mathrm e}$ \emph{not} $m_e$ (e = electron).
However, do not code for roman
if the sub/superscripts represent variables,
e.g.\ $\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}$.
\item
Please ensure that {\em physical units\/} (e.g.\ pc, erg s$^{-1}$
K, cm$^{-3}$, W m$^{-2}$ Hz$^{-1}$, m kg s$^{-2}$ A$^{-2}$) and
{\em abbreviations\/} such as Ord, Var, GL, SL, sgn, const.\
are always set in roman type. To ensure
this use the \verb|\mathrm| command: \verb|\mathrm{Hz}|.
On p.\ 44 of the {\em \LaTeX{} User's Guide \& Reference
Manual\/} by Leslie Lamport you will find the names of
common mathe\-matical functions, such as log, sin, exp, max and sup.
These should be coded as \verb|\log|,
\verb|\sin|, \verb|\exp|, \verb|\max|, \verb|\sup|
and will appear in roman automatically.
\item
Chemical symbols and formulas should be coded for roman,
e.g.\ Fe not $Fe$, H$_2$O not {\em H$_2$O}.
\item
Familiar foreign words and phrases, e.g.\ et al.,
a priori, in situ, brems\-strah\-lung, eigenvalues should not be
italicized.
\end{alpherate}
%
\section{How to Edit Your Input (Source) File}
\label{refedit}
%
\subsection{Headings}\label{headings}
%
All words in headings should be capitalized except for conjunctions,
prepositions (e.g.\ on, of, by, and, or, but, from, with, without,
under) and definite and indefinite articles (the, a, an) unless they
appear at the beginning. Formula letters must be typeset as in the text.
%
\subsection{Capitalization and Non-capitalization}
%
\begin{alpherate}
\item
The following should always be capitalized:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Headings (see preceding Sect.\,\ref{headings})
\item
Abbreviations and expressions
in the text such as  Fig(s)., Table(s), Sect(s)., Chap(s).,
Theorem, Corollary, Definition etc. when used with numbers, e.g.\
Fig.\,3, Table\,1, Theorem 2.
\end{itemize}
Please follow the special rules in Sect.\,\ref{abbrev} for referring to
equations.
\item
The following should {\em not\/} be capitalized:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The words figure(s), table(s), equation(s), theorem(s) in the text when
used without an accompanying number.
\item
Figure legends and table captions except for names and abbreviations.
\end{itemize}
\end{alpherate}
%
\subsection{Abbreviation of Words}\label{abbrev}
%
\begin{alpherate}
\item
The following {\em should} be abbreviated when they appear in running
text {\em unless\/} they come at the beginning of a sentence: Chap.,
Sect., Fig.; e.g.\ The results are depicted in Fig.\,5. Figure 9 reveals
that \dots .\\
{\em Please note\/}: Equations should usually be referred to solely by
their number in parentheses: e.g.\ (14). However, when the reference
comes at the beginning of a sentence, the unabbreviated word
``Equation'' should be used: e.g.\ Equation (14) is very important.
However, (15) makes it clear that \dots .
\item
If abbreviations of names or concepts are used
throughout the text, they should be defined at first occurrence,
e.g.\ Plurisubharmonic (PSH) Functions, Strong Optimization (SOPT)
Problem.
\end{alpherate}
%
\section{How to Code the Beginning of Your Contribution}
\label{contbegin}
%
The title of a single contribution (it is mandatory) should be coded as
follows:
\begin{verbatim}
\title{<Your contribution title>}
\end{verbatim}
All words in titles should be capitalized except for conjunctions,
prepositions (e.g.\ on, of, by, and, or, but, from, with, without,
under) and definite and indefinite articles (the, a, an) unless they
appear at the beginning. Formula letters must be typeset as in the text.
Titles have no end punctuation.

If a long \verb|\title| must be divided please use the code \verb|\\|
(for new line).

If you are to produce running heads for a specific volume the standard
(of no such running heads) is overwritten with the \verb|[runningheads]|
option in the \verb|\documentclass| line. For long titles that do not
fit in the single line of the running head a warning is generated.
You can specify an abbreviated title for the running head on odd pages
with the command
\begin{verbatim}
\titlerunning{<Your abbreviated contribution title>}
\end{verbatim}

There is also a possibility to change the text of the title that goes
into the table of contents (that's for volume editors only -- there is
no table of contents for a single contribution). For this use the
command
\begin{verbatim}
\toctitle{<Your changed title for the table of contents>}
\end{verbatim}

An optional subtitle may follow then:
\begin{verbatim}
\subtitle{<subtitle of your contribution>}
\end{verbatim}

Now the name(s) of the author(s) must be given:
\begin{verbatim}
\author{<author(s) name(s)>}
\end{verbatim}
Numbers referring to different addresses or affiliations are
to be attached to each author with the \verb|\inst{<no>}| command.
If there is more than one author, the order is up to you;
the \verb|\and| command provides for the separation.

If you have done this correctly, this entry now reads, for example:
\begin{verbatim}
\author{Ivar Ekeland\inst{1} \and Roger Temam\inst{2}}
\end{verbatim}
The first name\footnote{Other initials are optional
and may be inserted if this is the usual
way of writing your name, e.g.\ Alfred J.~Holmes, E.~Henry Green.}
is followed by the surname.

As for the title there exist two additional commands (again for volume
editors only) for a different author list. One for the running head
(on odd pages) -- if there is any:
\begin{verbatim}
\authorrunning{<abbreviated author list>}
\end{verbatim}
And one for the table of contents where the
affiliation of each author is simply added in braces.
\begin{verbatim}
\tocauthor{<enhanced author list for the table of contents>}
\end{verbatim}

Next the address(es) of institute(s), company etc. is (are) required.
If there is more than one address, the entries are numbered
automatically with \verb|\and|, in the order in which you type them.
Please make sure that the numbers match those placed next to
to the authors' names to reflect the affiliation.
\begin{verbatim}
\institute{<name of an institute>
\and <name of the next institute>
\and <name of the next institute>}
\end{verbatim}

In addition, you can use
\begin{verbatim}
\email{<email address>}
\end{verbatim}
to provide your email address within \verb|\institute|. If you need to
typeset the tilde character -- e.g. for your web page in your unix
system's home directory -- the \verb|\homedir| command will happily do
this. Please note that, if your email address is given in your paper,
it will also be included in the meta data of the online version.
\enlargethispage*{6mm}

\medskip
If footnote like things are needed anywhere in the contribution heading
please code
(immediately after the word where the footnote indicator should be
placed):
\begin{verbatim}
\thanks{<text>}
\end{verbatim}
\verb|\thanks| may only appear in \verb|\title|, \verb|\author|
and \verb|\institute| to footnote anything. If there are two or more
footnotes or affiliation marks to a specific item separate them with
\verb|\fnmsep| (i.e. {\itshape f}oot\emph note \emph mark
\emph{sep}arator).

\medskip\noindent
The command
\begin{verbatim}
\maketitle
\end{verbatim}
then formats the complete heading of your article. If you leave
it out the work done so far will produce \emph{no} text.

Then the abstract should follow. Simply code
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{abstract}
<Text of the summary of your article>
\end{abstract}
\end{verbatim}
or refer to the demonstration file {\tt llncs.dem} for an example or
to the {\em Sample Input\/} on p.~\pageref{samppage}.

\subsubsection{Remark to Running Heads and the Table of Contents}
\leavevmode\\[\medskipamount]
If you are the author of a single contribution you normally have no
running heads and no table of contents. Both are done only by the editor
of the volume or at the printers.
%
\section{Special Commands for the Volume Editor}
The volume editor can produce a complete camera ready output including
running heads, a table of contents, preliminary text (frontmatter), and
index or glossary. For activating the running heads there is the class
option \verb|[runningheads]|.

The table of contents of the volume is printed wherever
\verb|\tableofcontents| is placed. A simple compilation of all
contributions (fields \verb|\title| and \verb|\author|) is done. If you
wish to change this automatically produced list use the commands
\begin{verbatim}
\titlerunning  \toctitle
\authorrunning \tocauthor
\end{verbatim}
to enhance the information in the specific contributions. See the
demonstration file \verb|llncs.dem| for examples.

An additional structure can be added to the table of contents with the
\verb|\addtocmark{<text>}| command. It has an optional numerical
argument, a digit from 1 through 3. 3 (the default) makes an unnumbered
chapter like entry in the table of contents. If you code
\verb|\addtocmark[2]{text}| the corresponding page number is listed
also, \verb|\addtocmark[1]{text}| even introduces a chapter number
beyond it.
%
\section{How to Code Your Text}
%
The contribution title and all headings should be capitalized
except for conjunctions, prepositions (e.g.\ on, of, by, and, or, but,
from, with, without, under) and definite and indefinite articles (the,
a, an) unless they appear at the beginning. Formula letters must be
typeset as in the text.

Headings will be automatically numbered by the following codes.\\[2mm]
{\itshape Sample Input}
\begin{verbatim}
\section{This is a First-Order Title}
\subsection{This is a Second-Order Title}
\subsubsection{This is a Third-Order Title.}
\paragraph{This is a Fourth-Order Title.}
\end{verbatim}
\verb|\section| and \verb|\subsection| have no end punctuation.\\
\verb|\subsubsection| and \verb|\paragraph|
need to be punctuated at the end.

In addition to the above-mentioned headings your text may be structured
by subsections indicated by run-in headings (theorem-like environments).
All the theorem-like environments are numbered automatically
throughout the sections of your document -- each with its own counter.
If you want the theorem-like environments to use the same counter
just specify the documentclass option \verb|envcountsame|:
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[envcountsame]{llncs}
\end{verbatim}
If your first call for a theorem-like environment then is e.g.
\verb|\begin{lemma}|, it will be numbered 1; if corollary follows,
this will be numbered 2; if you then call lemma again, this will be
numbered 3.

But in case you want to reset such counters to 1 in each section,
please specify the documentclass option \verb|envcountreset|:
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[envcountreset]{llncs}
\end{verbatim}

Even a numbering on section level (including the section counter) is
possible with the documentclass option \verb|envcountsect|.

\section{Predefined Theorem like Environments}\label{builtintheo}
The following variety of run-in headings are at your disposal:
\begin{alpherate}
\item
{\bfseries Bold} run-in headings with italicized text
as built-in environments:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{corollary} <text> \end{corollary}
\begin{lemma} <text> \end{lemma}
\begin{proposition} <text> \end{proposition}
\begin{theorem} <text> \end{theorem}
\end{verbatim}
\item
The following generally appears as {\itshape italic} run-in heading:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{proof} <text>    \qed    \end{proof}
\end{verbatim}
It is unnumbered and may contain an eye catching square (call for that
with \verb|\qed|) before the environment ends.
\item
Further {\itshape italic} or {\bfseries bold} run-in headings with roman
environment body may also occur:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{definition} <text> \end{definition}
\begin{example} <text> \end{example}
\begin{exercise} <text> \end{exercise}
\begin{note} <text> \end{note}
\begin{problem} <text> \end{problem}
\begin{question} <text> \end{question}
\begin{remark} <text> \end{remark}
\begin{solution} <text> \end{solution}
\end{verbatim}
\end{alpherate}

\section{Defining your Own Theorem like Environments}
We have enhanced the standard \verb|\newtheorem| command and slightly
changed its syntax to get two new commands \verb|\spnewtheorem| and
\verb|\spnewtheorem*| that now can be used to define additional
environments. They require two additional arguments namely the type
style in which the keyword of the environment appears and second the
style for the text of your new environment.

\verb|\spnewtheorem| can be used in two ways.
\subsection{Method 1 {\itshape (preferred)}}
You may want to create an environment that shares its counter
with another environment, say {\em main theorem\/} to be numbered like
the predefined {\em theorem\/}. In this case, use the syntax
\begin{verbatim}
\spnewtheorem{<env_nam>}[<num_like>]{<caption>}
{<cap_font>}{<body_font>}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
Here the environment with which the new environment should share its
counter is specified with the optional argument \verb|[<num_like>]|.

\paragraph{Sample Input}
\begin{verbatim}
\spnewtheorem{mainth}[theorem]{Main Theorem}{\bfseries}{\itshape}
\begin{theorem} The early bird gets the worm. \end{theorem}
\begin{mainth} The early worm gets eaten. \end{mainth}
\end{verbatim}
\medskip\noindent
{\em Sample Output}

\medskip\noindent
{\bfseries Theorem 3.}\enspace {\em The early bird gets the worm.}

\medskip\noindent
{\bfseries Main Theorem 4.} The early worm gets eaten.

\bigskip
The sharing of the default counter (\verb|[theorem]|) is desired. If you
omit the optional second argument of \verb|\spnewtheorem| a separate
counter for your new environment is used throughout your document.

\subsection[Method 2]{Method 2 {\itshape (assumes {\tt[envcountsect]}
documentstyle option)}}
\begin{verbatim}
\spnewtheorem{<env_nam>}{<caption>}[<within>]
{<cap_font>}{<body_font>}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
This defines a new environment \verb|<env_nam>| which prints the caption
\verb|<caption>| in the font \verb|<cap_font>| and the text itself in
the font \verb|<body_font>|. The environment is numbered beginning anew
with every new sectioning element you specify with the optional
parameter \verb|<within>|.

\medskip\noindent
\paragraph{Example} \leavevmode

\medskip\noindent
\verb|\spnewtheorem{joke}{Joke}[subsection]{\bfseries}{\rmfamily}|

\medskip
\noindent defines a new environment called \verb|joke| which prints the
caption {\bfseries Joke} in boldface and the text in roman. The jokes are
numbered starting from 1 at the beginning of every subsection with the
number of the subsection preceding the number of the joke e.g. 7.2.1 for

\section{Fine Tuning of the Text}
%
The following should be used to improve the readability of the text:
\begin{flushleft}
\begin{tabular}{@{}p{.19\textwidth}p{.79\textwidth}}
\verb|\,|   & a thin space, e.g.\ between numbers or between units
              and num\-bers; a line division will not be made
              following this space\\
\verb|--|   & en dash; two strokes, without a space at either end\\
\verb*| -- |& en dash; two strokes, with  a space at either end\\
\verb|-|    & hyphen; one stroke, no space at either end\\

            & this -- written on a computer -- is now printed\\
            & $-30$\,K \dots
\end{tabular}
\end{flushleft}
%
\section {Special Typefaces}
%
Normal type (roman text) need not be coded. {\itshape Italic}
(\verb|{\em <text>}| better still \verb|\emph{<text>}|) or, if
necessary, {\bfseries boldface} should be used for emphasis.\\[6pt]
\begin{minipage}[t]{\textwidth}
\begin{flushleft}
\begin{tabular}{@{}p{.25\textwidth}@{\hskip6pt}p{.73\textwidth}@{}}
\verb|{\itshape Text}|   & {\itshape Italicized Text}\\[2pt]
\verb|{\em Text}|   & {\em Emphasized Text --
   if you would like to emphasize a {\em definition} within an
   italicized text (e.g.\ of a {\em theorem)} you should code the
   expression to be emphasized by} \verb|\em|.\\[2pt]
\verb|{\bfseries Text}|& {\bfseries Important Text}\\[2pt]
\verb|\vec{Symbol}| & Vectors may only appear in math mode. The default
   \LaTeX{} vector symbol has been adapted\footnotemark\
 to LLNCS conventions.\\[2pt]
 & \verb|$\vec{A \times B\cdot C}| yields $\vec{A\times B\cdot C}$\\
 & \verb|$\vec{A}^{T} \otimes \vec{B} \otimes|\\
 & \verb|\vec{\hat{D}}$|yields $\vec{A}^{T} \otimes \vec{B} \otimes
\vec{\hat{D}}$
\end{tabular}
\end{flushleft}
\end{minipage}

\footnotetext{If you absolutely must revive the original \LaTeX{}
design of the vector symbol (as an arrow accent), please specify the
option \texttt{[orivec]} in the \texttt{documentclass} line.}
\newpage
%
\section {Footnotes}
%
Footnotes within the text should be coded:
\begin{verbatim}
\footnote{Text}
\end{verbatim}
{\itshape Sample Input}
\begin{flushleft}
Text with a footnote\verb|\footnote{The |{\tt footnote is automatically
numbered.}\verb|}| and text continues \dots
\end{flushleft}
{\itshape Sample Output}
\begin{flushleft}
Text with a footnote\footnote{The footnote is automatically numbered.}
and text continues \dots
\end{flushleft}
%
\section {Lists}
%
Please code lists as described below:\\[2mm]
{\itshape Sample  Input}
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item First item
  \item Second item
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item First nested item
    \item Second nested item
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Third item
\end{enumerate}
\end{verbatim}
{\itshape Sample Output}
 \begin{enumerate}
\item First item
\item Second item
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item First nested item
    \item Second nested item
  \end{enumerate}
\item Third item
\end{enumerate}
%
\section {Figures}
%
Figure environments should be inserted after (not in)
the  paragraph in which the figure is first mentioned.
They will be numbered automatically.

Preferably the images should be enclosed as PostScript files -- best as
EPS data using the epsfig package.

If you cannot include them into your output this way and use other
techniques for a separate production,
the figures (line drawings and those containing halftone inserts
as well as halftone figures) {\em should not be pasted into your
laserprinter output}. They should be enclosed separately in camera-ready
form (original artwork, glossy prints, photographs and/or slides). The
lettering should be suitable for reproduction, and after a
probably necessary reduction the height of capital letters should be at
least 1.8\,mm and not more than 2.5\,mm.
Check that lines and other details are uniformly black and
that the lettering on figures is clearly legible.

To leave the desired amount of space for the height of
your figures, please use the coding described below.
As can be seen in the output, we will automatically
provide 1\,cm space above and below the figure,
so that you should only leave the space equivalent to the size of the
figure itself. Please note that ``\verb|x|'' in the following
coding stands for the actual height of the figure:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}
\vspace{x cm}
\caption[ ]{...text of caption...}          (Do type [ ])
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}
\begin{flushleft}
{\itshape Sample Input}
\end{flushleft}
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}
\vspace{2.5cm}
\caption{This is the caption of the figure displaying a white
eagle and a white horse on a snow field}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}
\begin{flushleft}
{\itshape Sample Output}
\end{flushleft}
\begin{figure}
\vspace{2.5cm}
\caption{This is the caption of the figure displaying a white eagle and
a white horse on a snow field}
\end{figure}
%
\section{Tables}
%
Table captions should be treated
in the same way as figure legends, except that
the table captions appear {\itshape above} the tables. The tables
will be numbered automatically.
%
\subsection{Tables Coded with \protect\LaTeX{}}
%
Please use the following coding:\\[2mm]
{\itshape Sample Input}
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{table}
\caption{Critical $N$ values}
\begin{tabular}{llllll}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
${\mathrm M}_\odot$ & $\beta_{0}$ & $T_{\mathrm c6}$ & $\gamma$
  & $N_{\mathrm{crit}}^{\mathrm L}$
  & $N_{\mathrm{crit}}^{\mathrm{Te}}$\\
\noalign{\smallskip}
\hline
\noalign{\smallskip}
 30 & 0.82 & 38.4 & 35.7 & 154 & 320 \\
 60 & 0.67 & 42.1 & 34.7 & 138 & 340 \\
120 & 0.52 & 45.1 & 34.0 & 124 & 370 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{verbatim}

\medskip\noindent{\itshape Sample Output}
\begin{table}
\caption{Critical $N$ values}
\begin{center}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.4}
\setlength\tabcolsep{3pt}
\begin{tabular}{llllll}
\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
${\mathrm M}_\odot$ & $\beta_{0}$ & $T_{\mathrm c6}$ & $\gamma$
  & $N_{\mathrm{crit}}^{\mathrm L}$
  & $N_{\mathrm{crit}}^{\mathrm{Te}}$\\
\noalign{\smallskip}
\hline
\noalign{\smallskip}
 30 & 0.82 & 38.4 & 35.7 & 154 & 320 \\
 60 & 0.67 & 42.1 & 34.7 & 138 & 340 \\
120 & 0.52 & 45.1 & 34.0 & 124 & 370 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Before continuing your text you need an empty line. \dots

\vspace{3mm}
For further information you will find a complete description of
the tabular environment
on p.~62~ff. and p.~204 of the {\em \LaTeX{} User's Guide \& Reference
Manual\/} by Leslie Lamport.
%
\subsection{Tables Not Coded with \protect\LaTeX{}}
%
If you do not wish to code your table using \LaTeX{}
but prefer to have it reproduced separately,
proceed as for figures and use the following coding:\\[2mm]
{\itshape Sample Input}
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{table}
\caption{text of your caption}
\vspace{x cm}     % the actual height needed for your table
\end{table}
\end{verbatim}
%
\subsection{Signs and Characters}
%
\subsubsection*{Special Signs.}
%
You may need to use special signs.  The available ones are listed in the
{\em \LaTeX{} User's Guide \& Reference Manual\/} by Leslie Lamport,
pp.~41\,ff.
We have created further symbols for math mode (enclosed in \$):
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace{1em}yields\hspace{1em}}
c@{\hspace{3em}}l@{\hspace{1em}yields\hspace{1em}}c}
\verb|\grole| & $\grole$ & \verb|\getsto| & $\getsto$\\
\verb|\lid|   & $\lid$   & \verb|\gid|    & $\gid$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
%
\subsubsection*{Gothic (Fraktur).}
%
If gothic letters are {\itshape necessary}, please use those of the
relevant \AmSTeX{} alphabet which are available using the amstex
package of the American Mathematical Society.

In \LaTeX{} only the following gothic letters are available:
\verb|$\Re$| yields $\Re$ and \verb|$\Im$| yields $\Im$. These should
{\itshape not\/} be used when you need gothic letters for your contribution.
Use \AmSTeX{} gothic as explained above. For the real and the imaginary
parts of a complex number within math mode you should use instead:
\verb|$\mathrm{Re}$| (which yields Re) or \verb|$\mathrm{Im}$| (which
yields Im).
%
\subsubsection*{Script.}
%
For script capitals use the coding
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace{1em}which yields\hspace{1em}}c}
\verb|$\mathcal{AB}$| & $\mathcal{AB}$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
(see p.~42 of  the \LaTeX{} book).
%
\subsubsection*{Special Roman.}
%
If you need other symbols than those below, you could use
the blackboard bold characters of \AmSTeX{},  but there might arise
capacity problems
in loading additional \AmSTeX{} fonts. Therefore  we created
the blackboard bold characters listed below.
Some of them are not esthetically
satisfactory. This need not deter you from using them:
in the final printed form they will be
replaced by the well-designed MT (monotype) characters of
the phototypesetting machine.
\begin{flushleft}
\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{ yields }
c@{\hspace{1.em}}ll@{ yields }c}
\verb|\bbbc| & (complex numbers)   & $\bbbc$
  & \verb|\bbbf| & (blackboard bold F) & $\bbbf$\\
\verb|\bbbh| & (blackboard bold H) & $\bbbh$
  & \verb|\bbbk| & (blackboard bold K) & $\bbbk$\\
\verb|\bbbm| & (blackboard bold M) & $\bbbm$
  & \verb|\bbbn| & (natural numbers N) & $\bbbn$\\
\verb|\bbbp| & (blackboard bold P) & $\bbbp$
  & \verb|\bbbq| & (rational numbers)  & $\bbbq$\\
\verb|\bbbr| & (real numbers)      & $\bbbr$
  & \verb|\bbbs| & (blackboard bold S) & $\bbbs$\\
\verb|\bbbt| & (blackboard bold T) & $\bbbt$
  & \verb|\bbbz| & (whole numbers)     & $\bbbz$\\
\verb|\bbbone| & (symbol one)      & $\bbbone$
\end{tabular}
\end{flushleft}
\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}{c}
\bbbc^{\bbbc^{\bbbc}} \otimes
\bbbf_{\bbbf_{\bbbf}} \otimes
\bbbh_{\bbbh_{\bbbh}} \otimes
\bbbk_{\bbbk_{\bbbk}} \otimes
\bbbm^{\bbbm^{\bbbm}} \otimes
\bbbn_{\bbbn_{\bbbn}} \otimes
\bbbp^{\bbbp^{\bbbp}}\\[2mm]
\otimes
\bbbq_{\bbbq_{\bbbq}} \otimes
\bbbr^{\bbbr^{\bbbr}} \otimes
\bbbs^{\bbbs_{\bbbs}} \otimes
\bbbt^{\bbbt^{\bbbt}} \otimes
\bbbz \otimes
\bbbone^{\bbbone_{\bbbone}}
\end{array}
\end{displaymath}
%
\section{References}
\label{refer}
%
There are three reference systems available; only one, of course,
should be used for your contribution. With each system (by
number only, by letter-number or by author-year) a reference list
containing all citations in the
text, should be included at the end of your contribution placing the
\LaTeX{} environment \verb|thebibliography| there.
For an overall information on that environment
see the {\em \LaTeX{} User's Guide \& Reference
Manual\/} by Leslie Lamport, p.~71.

There is a special {\sc Bib}\TeX{} style for LLNCS that works along
with the class: \verb|splncs.bst|
-- call for it with a line \verb|\bibliographystyle{splncs}|.
If you plan to use another {\sc Bib}\TeX{} style you are customed to,
please specify the option \verb|[oribibl]| in the
\verb|documentclass| line, like:
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[oribibl]{llncs}
\end{verbatim}
This will retain the original \LaTeX{} code for the bibliographic
environment and the \verb|\cite| mechanism that many {\sc Bib}\TeX{}
applications rely on.
%
\subsection{References by Letter-Number or by Number Only}
%
References are cited in the text -- using the \verb|\cite|
command of \LaTeX{} -- by number or by letter-number in square
brackets, e.g.\ [1] or [E1, S2], [P1], according to your use of the
\verb|\bibitem| command in the \verb|thebibliography| environment. The
coding is as follows: if you choose your own label for the sources by
giving an optional argument to the \verb|\bibitem| command the citations
in the text are marked with the label you supplied. Otherwise a simple
numbering is done, which is preferred.
\begin{verbatim}
The results in this section are a refined version
of \cite{clar:eke}; the minimality result of Proposition~14
was the first of its kind.
\end{verbatim}
The above input produces the citation: ``\dots\ refined version of
[CE1]; the min\-i\-mality\dots''. Then the \verb|\bibitem| entry of
the \verb|thebibliography| environment should read:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{thebibliography}{[MT1]}
.
.
\bibitem[CE1]{clar:eke}
Clarke, F., Ekeland, I.:
Nonlinear oscillations and boundary-value problems for
Hamiltonian systems.
