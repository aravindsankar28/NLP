>=20

> results. So anyone would be able to sit in on the talk.
>=20
> Title: Big(ger) Data in Software Engineering
>=20
> Abstract: My research is centered around analyzing Software
> Engineering (SE) datasets that are several orders of magnitude bigger
> than the typical SE datasets. Examples of my datasets include: all the
> mobile apps in the Google Play store, all of the world's Open Source
> projects, and hundreds of gigabytes of execution logs. Such large
> datasets, provide us with a unique view into the SE field.
>=20
> However, these large datasets also bring some tough challenges given
> their 4 V=92s (volume, variety, velocity, and veracity). Such =
challenges
> often complicate the analysis of the data and can invalidate the
> interpretation of the  results. In this talk, I present an overview of
> key results from several of my recent studies, and how my
> collaborators and I overcame these challenges. In particular, I will
> touch on some of the key research questions that I have tackled:
>=20
> - How can we pick a diverse sample of projects from all the available
> projects in the world for a case study?
> - How come the mobile app markets are growing so fast while still
> ensuring a high quality user experience?
>=20
> I will conclude my talk with some of the exciting research
> opportunities present in analyzing such large datasets.

> Bio: Meiyappan Nagappan is a postdoctoral fellow in the Software
> Analysis and Intelligence Lab (SAIL) at Queen's University, Canada. He
> is going to join the Software Engineering Faculty at Rochester
> Institute of Technology shortly. His research is centered around the
> use of large-scale Software Engineering (SE) data to address the
> concerns of the various stakeholders (e.g., developers, operators, and
> managers). He received a PhD in computer science from North Carolina
> State University.

> Dr. Nagappan has published in various top SE venues such as TSE, FSE,
> EMSE, and IEEE Software. He has also received a best paper award at

> academic researchers from the US, Canada, Japan, Germany, Chile, and
