Topic   : Approximate Inference in Undirected Graphical Models using Higher=
-order LP Relaxations=20
Venue   : BSB 361, Department of Computer Science & Engg.=20
Guide   : Dr. B. Ravindran

Abstract:=20
A number of problems in computer vision, natural language processing, compu=
tational biology and machine learning can be naturally cast as discrete lab=
eling problems. Undirected graphical models provide us a principled and eff=
icient way to model these problems by taking advantage of the sparsity of i=
nteraction among the variables. The task of finding the most probable assig=
nment corresponding to the joint distribution is called Maximum-a-Posterior=
i (MAP) inference. Except in few special cases, when the undirected graphic=
al model is tree-structured or has low tree-width, exact inference is intra=
ctable. Finding the MAP assignment remains hard even if the local functions=
 depend only on two variables. This has prompted extensive research into ap=
proximation algorithms, some of which often work well in practice. One of t=
he most popular families of approximation methods is Linear Programming (LP=
) relaxation. Although these LPs are generally tractable, general purpose L=
P solvers typically do not exploit the problem structure. Therefore a great=
 deal of effort has gone into designing solvers that are
specifically tailored to typical LP relaxations for MAP inference problems.=
 One class of particularly simple algorithms, which we will focus on here, =
are co-ordinate minimization based approaches.

Unfortunately, the standard co-ordinate minimization based algorithms are r=
arely tight for real world applications, i.e., they have a large integralit=
y gap. We propose an approach to iteratively tighten the relaxation by addi=
ng marginal constraints corresponding to larger cliques, which allows us to=
 add arbitrary length clusters unlike the existing approaches which restric=
ts the nature of clusters to be added. An additional advantage of our appro=
ach is that, it can also be used to perform MAP inference with higher-order=
 potentials. Unlike traditional message passing algorithms which operate un=
iformly on the whole graph, our method dynamically chooses regions to focus=
 message-passing efforts. We have also empirically established the fact tha=
t marginal constraints arising from the sub-cliques are sufficient to obtai=
n a tighter approximation even for problems with higher-order potentials. W=
e also propose a strategy for damping message passing updates, which would =
improve the rate of convergence of the standard co-ordinate minimization ba=
sed algorithms.
