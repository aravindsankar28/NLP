Dear Scholars 

Greetings. 

Today we have a talk by Dr. Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan from Yahoo! labs, Bangalore, titled 

"PAC Subset Selection in Stochastic Multi-armed Bandits". 

This is taking place at 3 PM at BSB 361. 

Abstract of the talk is as follows. 
We consider the problem of selecting, from among n real-valued random variables, a subset of size m of those with the highest means, based on efficiently sampling the random variables. This problem, which we denote Explore-m, finds application in a variety of areas, such as stochastic optimization, simulation and industrial engineering, and on-line advertising. The theoretical basis of our work is an extension of a previous formulation using multi-armed bandits that is devoted to identifying just the single best of n random variables (Explore-1). Under a PAC setting, we provide algorithms for Explore-m and bound their sample complexity. 


Our main contribution is the LUCB algorithm, which, interestingly, bears a close resemblance to the well-known UCB algorithm for regret minimization. We derive an expected sample complexity bound for LUCB that is novel even for single-arm selection. We then improve the problem-dependent constant in this bound through a novel algorithmic variant called KL-LUCB. Experiments affirm the relative efficiency of KL-LUCB over other algorithms for Explore-m. Our contributions also include a lower bound on the worst case sample complexity of such algorithms.
