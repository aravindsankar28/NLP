Dear All,

I am happy to invite all of you to my MS seminar on December 31, 2013 (
Tuesday) at 4:00 PM. Kindly make it convenient to attend the seminar and
give your valuable suggestions. The details of the talk are as follows:

Title               :  *Approximation Algorithms for special instances of
Guarding a Set of Segments*
Speaker         :    Anup Joshi
Guide            :    Dr. N. S. Narayanaswamy
Date & Time :   December 31, 2013(Tuesday) at 4:00 PM
Venue           :    CS 34, CSE Department


*Abstract:*
One of the classical problems in Theoretical Computer Science is Hitting
Set. We investigate a problem called Guarding a Set of Segments(GSS) which
is a hitting set problem on a set of line segments. The problem is, given a
set of line segments, how can one select a minimum number of points so that
every segment passes through at least one of the selected points. We
investigate this problem in the context of a 2-dimensional euclidean space.
The problem falls in the category of Art Gallery Problems, an example would
be to consider a road network approximated by a set of line segments on the
2-d plane, and the task is to observe all the roads by placing minimum
security cameras.

We present constant-factor approximation algorithms for special instances
of GSS by exploiting the structure of the underlying planar graph of a GSS
instance. In the underlying graph the vertex set consists of the
intersection points as well as the endpoints of the line segments, and the
edge set is the set of all pairs of vertices which are adjacent to each
other on a segment. We present a 3-factor approximation algorithm for the
special instances of GSS in which the underlying graph has girth at least
4. This also gives a 3-factor approximation for Hitting Set on GSS
instances satisfying the Helly Property. We also obtain a 2-factor
approximation algorithm for GSS instances whose underlying graph is
outerplanar.

*All are welcome!*
