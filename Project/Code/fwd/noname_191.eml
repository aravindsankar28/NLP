TITLE: Towards Behavioural Intelligence: Machine Learning Methods and Appli=
cations in Assisted Living=20


ABSTRACT: The development of computational methods for understanding human =
behaviour (physical and psychophysiological) presents one of the most excit=
ing challenges of the next decade in machine learning and its applications.=
 Behavioural intelligence describes the exclusive human ability to effectiv=
ely navigate and negotiate complex environments and social relationships, a=
nd its expression and experience are inherently characterized by individual=
 and contextual heterogeneity. However, advances in machine analysis of beh=
avioural cues (e.g., gaze exchange, smiles, head nods, crossed arms, laught=
er) or social signals (e.g., attention, empathy, agreement) are still in th=
eir infancy. This talk will present an overview of computational methods fo=
r understanding non-verbal cues in a Social Interaction Assistant device th=
at is intended to enrich the experience of social interactions for individu=
als with visual impairments. In particular, the talk will detail three mach=
ine learning methods developed for the Social Interaction Assistant: (i) Su=
pervised manifold learning for head pose estimation; (ii) Efficient conform=
al predictors for reliable person recognition; and (iii) Batch mode active =
learning for effective sample selection in video sequences. The obtained re=
sults show promise in the methods for the respective tasks on publicly avai=
lable datasets. The talk will conclude with pointers to directions for futu=
re research in machine learning to achieve behavioural intelligence in real=
-world settings, which can be applied in a wide range of settings including=
 smart healthcare, ubiquitous user interfaces, security and surveillance, a=
nd telecommunication.=20
