All, 

I will be giving my PhD seminar talk on 30th July , 2013 ( Tuesday ) at 2:30 PM at BSB 361. 

I request you to kindly attend the seminar and give your valuable suggestions. The details of the talk are as follows: 

Speaker : Shankar Raman M J (CS09D016) 
Date : 30-07-2013, Tuesday 
Time : 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM 
Topic : Methods to reduce power and delay in the Internet 
Venue : BSB 361, Department of Computer Science & Engg. 
Guides : Prof. V. Kamakoti / Dr. Gaurav Raina 

Abstract: 
The Internet consumes about 2% of the total generated power in the world. With increasing 
bandwidth of the devices attached to the Internet, power consumed by the networking devices is 
becoming a major concern. We address the problem of reducing power consumption by dividing 
the Internet into three distinct layers namely: device, network and transport layers. In this seminar 
we consider methods to reduce power consumption at the network layer. The network layer of 
the Internet is used for routing data packets. We propose a method that can be applied to various 
levels of the Internet routing hierarchy to reduce power and delay. The highest level of the 
Internet hierarchy is made up of Autonomous Systems (AS) that are owned by Internet Service 
Providers (ISPs). AS use the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to exchange routing information. 
We propose a power-metric based approach, in addition to the policy-based approach used by BGP, 
to route data packets between AS. Using this metric, the AS Border Router identifies low-power 
paths from a source to a destination and routes data packets through them. Simulations show that 
there could be significant savings in power. A trade-off in using such an approach is the increase 
in the number of hops between the source and the destination: a consequence of re-routing data 
packets. This can lead to increased delays between the end systems. We propose an ant-colony 
based heuristic which can be used to balance both power and delay in the Internet. 

All are welcome
