Dear All 

There seems to be another seminar scheduled in BSB 361 at the same time. 

The revised venue for the talk on "Safetly Logic Electronics for Nuclear Reactor Systems" is CS24 and there is no change in time. 

Regards 
Shankar.

Subject: Seminar Talk on Safetly Logic Electronics for Nuclear Reactor Systems 





Dear All 




Manoj Misra (CS08S005) will give a seminar talk on "Design, Safety Analysis and Reliability Analysis of a Nuclear Reactor Protection Logic System" in the department tomorrow. 


Venue: BSB 361 
Time : 2:00 - 2:50 pm 
Date : Tuesday, 12th February, 2013 



In nuclear reactors, emergency shutdown systems are used to diminish the reactor power rapidly during abnormal conditions which could otherwise lead to undesirable states such as fuel failure, channel failure or liberation of fission products. The talk will cover the design of safety logic for the electronics that is used in the emergency shutdown process. The talk will also cover the implementation details, fabrication and testing of the safety logic. This system is currently being tested in a live plant. 


Speaker's Bio: 


Manoj K Misra is a Scientific Officer (F level) at the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research, Kalpakkam. His research interests are in the area of safety critical instrumentation and control systems for nuclear reactors. He is currently pursuing his MS in the CSE department.
