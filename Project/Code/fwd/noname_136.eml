Dear All,=20


Dr. Sriraam Natarajan from Indiana University will be giving a seminar on s=
tatistical relational learning for predictive personalized medicine on Tues=
day 10th September, at 2 p.m. in BSB 361. All are welcome. Details below.=

Title: Statistical Relational Learning for Predictive Personalized Medicine=
=20


Abstract: Recent advances in medicine and electronic book-keeping have grea=
tly increased the amount of medical data available for research and clinica=
l decision making. Electronic Health Records include information about test=
 results, lab reports, medical images, genomics, treatments, outcomes, and =
family histories. Together with recent advances in data mining and machine =
learning, it now seems possible to realize the grand vision of predictive p=
ersonalized medicine.=20


Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) combines the powerful formalisms of p=
robability theory and first-order logic to handle uncertainty in large, com=
plex problems. In this talk, I illustrate the potential of SRL to achieve a=
n important sub-goal of predictive medicine: early detection. Specifically,=
 I will present SRL approaches for (1) identifying young adults who are at =
high risk of developing Coronary Heart Disease in middle and later life, an=
d (2) identifying the set of patients who have or will have Alzheimer's Dis=
ease by analyzing their brain MRI images. I will present a general approach=
 for learning SRL models based on Functional-Gradient Boosting. I will adap=
t this algorithm for the above mentioned challenging tasks to produce state=
-of-the-art results in three real-world medical studies. I will outline oth=
er interesting problems in personalized medicine that we are addressing usi=
ng SRL and conclude on the optimistic note that predictive personalized med=
icine is within reach in the near future. Bio: Sriraam Natarajan is an Assi=
stant Professor at the School of Informatics and Computing at Indiana Unive=
rsity. He was previously an Assistant Professor at Wake Forest University S=
chool of Medicine, a Post-Doctoral Research Associate at University of Wisc=
onsin-Madison and graduated with his PhD from Oregon State University. His =
research interests lie in the field of Artificial Intelligence, with emphas=
is on Machine Learning, Statistical Relational AI, Reinforcement Learning a=
nd Graphical Models with applications in Biomedicine and Health Informatics=
. He is a Senior Program Committee member of IJCAI 2013 and has served on t=
he PC of several conferences/workshops such as AAAI, IJCAI, ICML, ECML, ILP=
 and SRL. He has co-organized the AAAI 2013, AAAI 2010 and the UAI 2012 wor=
kshops on Statistical Relational AI (StarAI), the 2012 Workshop on SRL and =
the ECML PKDD 2011 and 2012 workshops on Collective Learning and Inference =
on Structured Data (Co-LISD).
