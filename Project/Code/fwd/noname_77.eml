Dear all,=20

Talk Title: Accuracy-Aware Program Transformations=20

Speaker : Sasa Misailovic=20

Time and Venue : Feb 20th 12:00 - 13:00 PM at BSB361=20

Abstract:=20

Despite the fact that approximate computations have come to dominate many a=
reas of computer science, the field of program transformations has focused =
almost exclusively on traditional semantics-preserving transformations that=
 do not attempt to exploit the opportunity, available in many computations,=
 to acceptably trade off accuracy for benefits such as increased performanc=
e and reduced resource consumption.=20


We present a model of computation for approximate computations and an algor=
ithm for optimizing these computations. The algorithm works with two classe=
s of transformations: substitution transformations (which select one of a n=
umber of available implementations for a given function, with each implemen=
tation offering a different combination of accuracy and resource consumptio=
n) and sampling transformations (which randomly discard some of the inputs =
to a given reduction). The algorithm produces a (1+=CE=B5) randomized appro=
ximation to the optimal randomized computation (which minimizes resource co=
nsumption subject to a probabilistic accuracy specification in the form of =
a maximum expected error or maximum error variance).=20
Bio:=20

Sasa Misailovic received his B.Sc. in Computer Science from the School of E=
E, Univ. of Belgrade, Serbia. He is currently a graduate student at the Dep=
t. of EE&CS at MIT. His current research interests includes program analysi=
s, software engineering, and programming languages.=20
