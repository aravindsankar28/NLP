Dear All=20


Please mark your calendar for a talk by Anirudh Sivaraman on a new transpor=
t protocol=20
for interactive applications. He is our alumnus from the 2010 B. Tech batch=
.=20


Venue : BSB 361=20
Date : 22 August, 2013=20
Time : 2 pm=20

Title:=20
------=20
Sprout : Stochastic Forecasts Achieve High Throughput and Low Delay=20
over Cellular Networks=20

Abstract:=20
--------=20
Sprout is a transport protocol for interactive applications that=20
desire high throughput and low delay. Sprout does not use TCP-style=20
reactive congestion control; instead the receiver observes the packet=20
arrival times to infer the uncertain dynamics of the network path.=20
This inference is used to forecast how many bytes may be sent by the=20
sender, while bounding the risk that packets will be delayed inside=20
the network for too long. In evaluations on traces from commercial LTE=20
and 3G networks, Sprout achieved 2=E2=80=934 times the throughput of Skype,=
=20
Apple Facetime, and Google Hangout, while reducing self-inflicted=20
delay by 7=E2=80=939 times. Sprout is joint work with Keith Winstein and Ha=
ri=20
Balakrishnan. For more details, please visit: http://alfalfa.mit.edu=20

Bio:=20
---------=20
Anirudh Sivaraman is a third year Phd student at MIT working with=20
Professor Hari Balakrishnan. He previously completed his Masters at=20
MIT in 2012, and his BTech in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT=20
Madras in 2010. His current research interests are in the areas of=20
mobile computing and cellular wireless networks. While at IITM, along=20
with a few others, he started iBOT, IITM's Robotics Club. He was also=20
active in the organizing committee of Shaastra as Robotics Coordinator=20
in 2008, and Events Core in 2009.
