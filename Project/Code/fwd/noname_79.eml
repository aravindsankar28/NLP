Hello all,=20
There is a talk in CS25 at 3pm on "Using a Push-Button Verifying Compiler t=
o Build Verified Software Components " .=20

Thanks,=20
Sriram=20

Title: Using a Push-Button Verifying Compiler to Build Verified Software Co=
mponents=20
Murali Sitaraman (Clemson)=20
Bruce W. Weide (Ohio State)=20

Abstract: In this talk, students will see how to design, specify, and imple=
ment verified software components using a web-integrated software engineeri=
ng environment that requires no software installation. The talk will discus=
s how to engineer specifications and how to design and annotate object-base=
d component implementations of software components. To make the ideas concr=
ete, the talk will use RESOLVE, an integrated specification and programming=
 language especially designed for building verified components, which featu=
res a prototype =E2=80=9Cpush-button=E2=80=9D verifying compiler. It will a=
lso summarize the presenters=E2=80=99 experiences in adapting a RESOLVE dis=
cipline of component-based development to C++ and Java.=20

Organizer biographies:=20

Murali Sitaraman is Professor of Computer Science in the School of Computin=
g at Clemson. He directs the RESOLVE/Reusable Software Research Group (RSRG=
) at Clemson. His research spans a spectrum of foundational, practical, and=
 educational topics in software engineering, and it has been supported by U=
S NSF grants continuously for over 20 years. He has co-edited a book on Fou=
ndations of Component-Based Systems with Gary Leavens for Cambridge Univers=
ity Press. Together with members of his group, he has published over 100 pa=
pers in various forums. He has offered tutorials and workshops to educators=
 on teaching mathematical reasoning at the ACM SIGCSE conference several ti=
mes, including each of the last four years. Sitaraman has taught these idea=
s to graduate and undergraduate students for over 20 years.=20

Bruce W. Weide is Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Ohio Sta=
te University. He and his colleagues in the RESOLVE/Reusable Software Resea=
rch Group (RSRG) have studied design, specification, and verification of co=
mponent-based software. Weide and his colleague, Prof. Tim Long, were award=
ed the IEEE Computer Society Computer Science and Engineering Undergraduate=
 Teaching Award in 2000 =E2=80=9Cfor innovative work in the content and ped=
agogy of introductory computer science education, linking research advances=
 in software engineering with educational delivery of the material taught i=
n the introductory courses.=E2=80=9D Weide has taught these ideas to gradua=
te and undergraduate students for over 30 years.=20
