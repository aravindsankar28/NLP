Dear All,=20






Dr. Sriram Narasimhan (see brief profile below) will be visiting us on 4th =
August and giving a talk (see abstract below) at 3:00 PM at BSB 361.=20

Best Regards,=20

Abstract :=20

System health management deals with supporting the operation of a system in=
 the presence of faults in one or more components (hardware and software) o=
f the system being monitored. Tasks involved include diagnosis (fault detec=
tion, isolation and identification), prognosis (fault impact analysis, end =
of life prediction), decision making (fault mitigation and recovery). The e=
nd goal is to maximize the achievement of original system objectives while =
maintaining the requirements of safety and cost. Model-based diagnosis tech=
niques use structural, behavioral and/or functional models of the system to=
 detect and isolate faults. Given the wide variety of faults (component/sen=
sor, discrete/continuous, persistent/intermittent etc.) that occur in real =
systems and the presence of uncertainties (sensor noise, unknown environmen=
t etc.) no single technique can handle all situations effectively and effic=
iently. In this talk I will present 2 model-based diagnosis techniques (FAC=
T and HyDE) that deal with entirely different situations. FACT uses a forma=
l modeling framework and diagnoses single parametric faults (abrupt change =
in parameter value) while HyDE uses a more general modeling framework to di=
agnosis multiple discrete faults (abrupt change in state of component). The=
se 2 approaches are just a couple of drops in the large ocean of techniques=
 proposed by researchers in the model-based and other (data-driven for exam=
ple) communities. I will also present work I was involved in that attempted=
 to develop a standard set of metrics to evaluate and compare various diagn=
osis methodologies. This work also resulted in the development of a framewo=
rk to execute diagnostic applications on a common platform which led to a s=
eries of international diagnostic competitions. Finally I will present some=
 applications at NASA that are using/have used model-based reasoning applic=
ations.=20

Sriram Narasimhan is a Project Scientist with University of California, San=
ta Cruz working as a contractor at NASA Ames Research Center in the Discove=
ry and Systems Health area. His research interests are in model-based reaso=
ning with a focus on diagnosis, prognosis and decision making on hybrid and=
 stochastic systems. He is the technical lead for the Hybrid Diagnosis Engi=
ne (HyDE) project. He has been involved in the development of model-based r=
easoning applications for several NASA systems including the Total Organic =
Carbon Analyzer on board International Space Station, K11 Rover, Cryogenic =
fuel loading system among others. He received his M.S and Ph.D. in Electric=
