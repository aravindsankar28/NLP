Abstract:=20

We are entering an era that will usher dramatic changes in most industries =
via exploitation of data. With the availability of abundant computing power=
, proliferation of data from sensors and increasing digitization of data th=
at used to be in non-electronic form, there are opportunities to enable tra=
nsformations in the way the world is run. We present examples of problems t=
hat can be tackled in Healthcare, Education, Banking and Transportation dom=
ains, each with a potential to positively impact the lives of millions of p=
eople. We further describe unique challenges like scale, heterogeneity and =
poor infrastructure in growth markets like India, which often require new a=
pproaches. Diving deeper into the healthcare industry, we present prelimina=
ry work that shows the applicability of remote sensing and data analytics t=
o measure body vitals such as respiration and heart rate, and also to diagn=
ose diseases such as breast cancer and atrial fibrillation (a form of cardi=
ac arrhythmia). As more of the patients=E2=80=99 medical history gets captu=
red in electronic health record systems, there is a further promise of appl=
ying real-time predictive analytics to assist doctors in practicing evidenc=
e-based medicine. We present work that significantly improves upon the stat=
e of the art for a variety of problems, including prediction of serious com=
plications such as acute hypotensive episodes for patients in an ICU, and p=
redicting the probability of a patient requiring ICU admission. Finally, we=
 present some observations on the common aspects of these solutions across =
various industry verticals, characterizing these as technology support to e=
nable highly personalized services at massive scale and describe some outst=
anding challenges .=20
