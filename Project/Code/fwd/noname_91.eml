Title: Reliable Data Transfer Mechanisms for Smart Grid Networks 
Speaker: M. Karthick, CS11S004 
Date: 21st January, 2014 
Time: 2:00 PM 
Venue: BSB 361 (Seminar Hall), Dept. of CSE. 

Abstract: 

Smart Grid is a collection of different technologies handling many aspects of power grid modernization. It involves activities aimed at 
making the power grid more reliable, secure and resilient using information and communication technologies. To enhance the wide area 
monitoring capabilities of the Smart Grid, Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and related equipment are being deployed at various locations 
in the grid. These PMUs measure synchro-phasors consisting of voltage, current and frequency measurements at synchronized time 
intervals. This data is then fed to various processing, monitoring, control, archival and market brokerage applications using a 
communication network. The Smart grid applications running at the control centers require strict quality-of-service guarantees in terms 
of low latency and high reliability. As per the NASPInet framework, data loss of crucial control data is not acceptable and data 
reliability is an important design goal. The existing mechanism, called as Gridstat, which provides data reliability is inefficient in 
terms of bandwidth usage. In order to reduce network traffic while improving reliability of real-time data, Forward Error Correction 
based fault tolerance mechanisms are needed. In this work, we have proposed three mechanisms based on multi-path transmissions, 
source-coding and network-coding techniques. The proposed mechanisms are compared with the existing mechanism using an OMNeT++ based 
discrete event simulation model. The proposed mechanisms are shown to have lower bandwidth requirement while providing higher reliability 
than the existing mechanism.
