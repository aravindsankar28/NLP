Abstract :-

Various Centrality measures such as Degree, Closeness, and Betweenness were
introduced in order to analyze
networks and understand both the global dynamics of the networks and the
roles played by individual nodes.
It will be worthwhile to rank the centrality measures of each node and an
index of the distribution of centrality
measures in the entire network. In this proposal, we de=EF=AC=81ne the noti=
on of
entropy of centrality measures, which
extends the concept of centrality to the whole network. We show that this
measure has wide range of applications,
in network design, from designing maximally e=EF=AC=83cient networks to ide=
ntifying
dominance of one node or link in the
context of entire network. In particular, we present an application to
tactical wireless networks.

This entropy measure also provides a good handle in analyzing the routing
e=EF=AC=83ciency on each link in the context
of the chosen routing strategy and the topology design. We propose a local
search algorithm, which consists of
=EF=AC=81nding appropriate weights of links in the network that results in =
maximum
entropy of shortest paths
betweenness-centrality. This implies that the shortest paths are
distributed between the links as even as possible
given the topology constraints. We feel this measurement makes a strong
case for considering betweenness-centrality
measures and their entropy in designing maximally e=EF=AC=83cient topologie=
s, and
improving the resiliency and quality of routing.
