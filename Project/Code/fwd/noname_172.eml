> Title: Computer Systems and High Performance Computing Research at the Uni=
versity of North Texas

> Abstract:
>=20
> This talk focuses on techniques to improve the performance of applications=
 in general, and HPC applications more specifically. At UNT, we have been de=
veloping simulators and tracing tools in order to identify performance bottl=
enecks and evaluate techniques for minimizing the impact of these bottleneck=
s. It is an understatement to say that the performance of multicore systems i=
s limited by their memory systems=E2=80=99 performance. Our research has dev=
eloped both hardware and software solutions to improve the performance of ca=
che memories, and how new memory technologies such as 3D stacked DRAMs, Phas=
e Change Memories can be included in the memory hierarchies. Software soluti=
ons include profiling of data access patterns, relocating data, and restruct=
uring code to improve performance. Hardware solutions include customizing ca=
che address mapping (or indexing) for different threads and/or different obj=
ects within an application, simultaneous existence of multiple address mappi=
ngs, eliminating unnecessary write-backs in memory hierarchy and better memo=
ry management. We are also evaluating our approaches in the context of emerg=
ing memory technologies including 3D DRAMs and non-volatile memories.

> Dr. Krishna Kavi is currently a Professor of Computer Science and Engineer=
ing and the Director of the NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Cen=
ter for Net-Centric Software and Systems at the University of North Texas. D=
uring 2001-2009, he served as the Chair of the department. He also held an E=
ndowed Chair Professorship in Computer Engineering at the University of Alab=
ama in Huntsville, and served on the faculty of the University Texas at Arli=
ngton. He was a Scientific Program Manger at US National Science Foundation d=
uring 1993-1995. He served on several editorial boards and program committee=
s.

> His research is primarily on Computer Systems Architecture including multi=
-threaded and multi-core processors, cache memories and hardware assisted me=
mory managers. He also conducted research in the area of formal methods, par=
allel processing, and real-time systems. He published more than 150 technica=
l papers in these areas. He received more than US $5 M in research grants. H=
e graduated 14 PhDs and more than 35 MS students. He received his PhD from S=
outhern Methodist University in Dallas Texas and a BS in EE from the Indian I=
nstitute of Science in Bangalore, India.
