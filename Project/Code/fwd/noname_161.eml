Dear Colleagues/Students:

Dr Rajasekar Krishnamurthy (IBM Research, USA) is visiting the Dept and
giving a talk on August 1st at 4pm in BSB 361. The details of the talk are
as below. All are welcome. Regards. -- psk

*Title: *Declarative Analytics: Applications and Tools
 *
Abstract*:  Modern enterprises are performing complex analyses on
increasingly large data sets to drive business decisions. Applications
rapidly gaining importance include social media analytics for digital
marketing and brand management, root cause analysis from system logs, and
financial and counterparty analytics from public data. These applications
rely heavily on key analytics phases comprising of text analytics, entity
resolution, and statistical analysis. The size of the data-sets in
conjunction with the complexity of the analysis necessitates large-scale
distributed processing of the analytical algorithms. At IBM we are building
tools and technologies to support each of these analytic phases and in
particular we are building declarative languages for these phases. While
the declarative nature of the language abstracts away the need for
programmer-optimization, the syntax of these languages is designed to
appeal to the corresponding communities. In this talk I will give an
overview of some real-world big data applications we are currently working
on, use that to motivate the need for the major analytic phases discussed
above and describe, in some detail, declarative systems for text analytics
and statistical modeling.

*Biography*: Dr. Rajasekar Krishnamurthy leads the Intelligent Information
Integration group at IBM Research-Almaden. He received a B.Tech in Computer
Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras in
1998, and a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the University of
Wisconsin-Madison in 2004. His research interests are primarily in the
integration of structured and unstructured data, with emphasis on
information extraction, entity resolution and data cleansing.
