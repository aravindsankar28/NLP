> Abstract: Modern enterprises are complex systems operating in highly =
dynamic environment. The time to respond to the various change drivers =
is short and the cost of incorrect decisions is prohibitively high. =
Large enterprises adopt organizational structure best suited for ease of =
management and control. Scattered and fractured knowledge =96 about =
goals, operational processes, IT systems, design rationale, IT =
infrastructure, guidelines and best practices etc =96 is the undesirable =
side-effect. As a result, response to a change can at best be locally =
optimal and sequence of locally optimal responses hardly ever leads to =
global optimality. Moreover, many a change response ripple across the =
width and depth of enterprise =96 from strategy to operational processes =
to IT systems to IT infrastructure =96 all=20

concern is addressed by relying solely on human experts who are expected =
to keep track of the various influencing factors, their =
inter-dependence, the decisions these factors influence, and =
interdependence of these decisions. This is too big an ask considering =
the size and complexity of modern enterprises. We are developing an =
approach based on modeling the relevant aspects of enterprise, its IT =
systems and IT infrastructure so as to address this challenge in a =
pro-active manner leading to enhanced quality of decision-making.=20

toolset that has been used to deliver several large business-critical =
systems since 1995. Much of this work has found way into OMG standards, =
three of which Vinay contributed to in a leadership role. A Visiting =
Professor at Middlesex University, London, Vinay serves on several =
program committees of international conferences. His interests include =
software engineering, model driven development and enterprise modeling.
