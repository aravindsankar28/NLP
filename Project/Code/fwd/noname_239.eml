Subject: Seminar Talk on Safetly Logic Electronics for Nuclear Reactor Syst=
ems

Dear All

Manoj Misra (CS08S005) will give a seminar talk on "Design, Safety Analysis=
 and Reliability Analysis of a Nuclear Reactor Protection Logic System" in =
the department tomorrow.

Venue:  BSB 361
Time  : 2:00 - 2:50 pm
Date   : Tuesday, 12th February, 2013

In nuclear reactors, emergency shutdown systems are used to diminish the re=
actor power rapidly during abnormal conditions which could otherwise lead t=
o undesirable states such as fuel failure, channel failure or liberation of=
 fission products. The talk will cover the design of safety logic for the e=
lectronics that is used in the emergency shutdown process. The talk will al=
so cover the implementation details, fabrication and testing of the safety =
logic. This system is currently being tested in a live plant.

Speaker's Bio:

Manoj K Misra is a Scientific Officer (F level) at the Indira Gandhi Centre=
 for Atomic Research, Kalpakkam. His research interests are in the area of =
safety critical instrumentation and control systems for nuclear reactors. H=
e is currently pursuing his MS in the CSE department.
