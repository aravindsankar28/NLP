Dear All,

Prof.Helmut Jurgensen from University of Western Ontario, Canada will
be visiting IITM on 7th Feb. He will be giving a talk at the
department. Please find below the details.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Title : Automata for Codes
Speaker : Prof. Helmut Jurgensen (University of Western Ontario)
Date & TIme : Feb 7, 2014, Friday, 3pm - 4pm.
Venue : BSB 361
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract : We survey the actual and potential r=F4les of automata in the
modelling of information
transmission systems and, in particular, in the encoder, channel and
decoder components of such systems. Our focus is on applications of
codes in such systems and on the relevance of automaton theoretic
methods to these applications. We discuss, for example, the issues of
error-detection, fault-tolerance and error-correction for
variable-length codes. Beyond reviewing known work in a possibly new
setting, we also present some recent results on fault-tolerant
decoders for systems in which synchronization errors are likely. We
conclude with a kind of research programme, a list of rather general
open problems requiring solutions.

Best regards,
Jayalal
