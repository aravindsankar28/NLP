Dear All,

I cordially invite you to my first PhD seminar on 12th February, 2013 (Tuesday) at 2 pm at CS 25 (Seminar Hall).
Kindly attend the seminar and give your valuable suggestions. 

Details of the talk:
Title: Data Driven Pronunciation Models for Speech Recognition
Speaker: R. Golda Brunet
Date: 12th February, 2013 (Tuesday)
Time: 2 pm
Venue: CS 25 (Seminar Hall), Dept of CSE


Abstract:
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems account for wide variability in the acoustic signal through large amounts of training data. From a linguistic point of view, the acoustic variability is a consequence of pronunciation variation. It is well known that  (i) two speakers cannot utter the same words exactly the same way or (ii) a single speaker can not repeat the same word exactly the same way. 
 To account for this variability ASR systems usually rely on multiple pronunciation lexicons to match an acoustic sequence with a lexical unit. 
However, the number of lexical variants required for improving recognition performance is not clear as pronunciation varies significantly across dialects.

A systematic study is carried out to observe the effect of pronunciation variation on recognition accuracy. In particular, a data-driven approach is employed to observe pronunciation variation at syllable level. The syllable boundaries are obtained using Group Delay (GD) segmentation. Auditory analysis of the acoustic syllable segments are then carried out to label them. The pronunciation lexicon is then generated from the lables of acoustic syllable segments. The preliminary experiments carried out for TIMIT corpus reveal that the use of prominent pronunciation variants for each dialect leads to improved recognition performance.

Thanks and Regards,
R. Golda Brunet
