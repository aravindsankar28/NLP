> Price of Anarchy, Auctions, and Approximations.

> In many applications driven by the internet, computation needs to be
> performed in the presence of strategic interactions between multiple
> autonomous entities. This raises the question: What happens when the
> input to an algorithm are controlled by rational agents, and each of
> them has a stake in the algorithm's output? A systematic study of this
> question led to the inception and growth of ``algorithmic game
> theory''. In the talk I will focus on two important topics within this
> field -- the study of auctions, and price of anarchy.
> 
> Motivated by the electronic markets such as eBay and Google adwords, I
> will first visit the topic of Auction Theory from an algorithmic
> perspective. In this setting, an auctioneer wants to sell some items
> to a group of bidders. The bidders' valuations for the items are
> private knowledge, but they are drawn from publicly known prior
> distributions. An auction scheme is called ``truthful'' if it gives an
> incentive to every bidder to report her true value. The goal is to
> find a truthful auction that maximizes the seller's revenue.
> 
> Naturally, to execute the optimal auction we need to know the prior
> distributions. An intriguing question is to design a truthful auction
> that does not require the knowledge of these priors, but still manages
> to get a constant fraction of the optimal revenue. Such auctions are
> called {\em prior-free}. I will conclude the first part of the talk by
> presenting my recent work on prior-free auctions with asymmetric
> bidders.
> 
> Next, I will consider the game-theoretic variant of a classical
> scheduling-problem. The setting captures a distributed environment
> with heterogeneous machines (or data centers) and jobs (or clients)
> that are situated across different geographical locations. The
> objective is to minimize the weighted sum of the completion times of
> the jobs. Each job, however, is a selfish agent and selects a machine
> that minimizes its own completion time. This defines a game between
> the jobs. A Nash equilibrium of this game is an outcome where no job
> wants to switch to another machine. The ``price of anarchy'' is now
> defined as the maximum possible ratio between the objective at a Nash
> equilibrium and the objective at the globally-optimal outcome.
> 
> I will present a generic characterization of the scheduling policies
> which give a small Price of Anarchy. On the technical side, I will
> show how to derive this result using a linear program for the
> underlying optimization problem and dual-fitting.
> 
> I will conclude the talk by presenting some interesting open
> directions for future research.
