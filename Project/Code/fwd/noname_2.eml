name in the field of learning on graphs. He will be visiting the CSE
Department on Friday the 21st. He is giving a talk at 11 a.m. in BSB 361.
Details below. All are welcome.

> If any one is interested in a one-on-one meeting with him, please let me
know. Partha is here till late in the evening. There will be an interaction

> Title: Graph-based methods for Web-scale Knowledge Harvesting
> Abstract: Harvesting knowledge from web-scale text datasets has emerged
as an interesting and promising area of research over the last few years,
resulting in the construction of several large knowledge bases (KBs).
Graphs provide a natural way to organize such harvested knowledge.
Moreover, graph-based learning and inference methods have proved to be
effective in the construction of such KBs. In this talk, I shall present an
overview of my research in this area, with examples and applications of
techniques ranging from graph-based semi-supervised learning to random walk
inference over knowledge graphs.
