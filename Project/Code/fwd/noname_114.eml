Dear Scholars, 

Next Thursday there will be DCC meeting, where I have to put forward issues and concerns from the scholars side. In one of my last mail I proposed that we can have a discussion among ourselves regarding the points to be discussed there. 

Can we have a small meeting on this just before Dileep's talk? I will be there at 3 PM in RSB. If anyone of you want to raise some issue to be discussed in the forthcoming DCC meeting please feel free to come and tell the same to me. I will take it to the committee. 

Regards, 

Joy

Dear Scholars 


Greetings. 

We will be having a presentation by K V S Dileep on Nov 4h 2013 (Monday) 3.30 PM. Venue is Research Scholar's Bay. 

Please make it convenient to attend the upcoming Talk on November 4 2013 3.30 PM 

Speaker: K V S Dileep (AIDB LAB) 
Title : Power law and Fractals: Implications in the real world 

Abstract : 
This talk will be an introduction to mathematical objects called fractals and their applications in the real world 
with focus on various disciplines in computer science especially data mining. It will be on an introductory level 
abstracting out the gory details and try to provide an intuitive understanding of different concepts. 

Kind regards 
Mani
