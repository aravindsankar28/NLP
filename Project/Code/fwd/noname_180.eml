Hello,

I was wondering whether we could have a system similar to that of IIT
Bombay, where the webpage at www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~studentname is moved to
www.cse.iitm.ac.in/alumni/~studentname on graduation.

I only want to get the point across that, we, as students, have a certain
amount of pride and feeling of belonging associated with the department and
our alma mater. And to me, personally, getting the webspace purged sounds
like severing last ties with my own department.

If we look at it from a logistics point of view, I don't think we would be
requiring any significant space anyway as most of our webpages are lean,
just static html with a couple of pictures, negligible when we talk about
storage in terms of GBs.

I would like to suggest one solution: our home folders, as it is currently
being done, get purged (that way, bulk of the storage space occupied will
be recovered), but the public_html folder, in which we have our webpages,
gets archived.

It would be nice to get to know the administrators' viewpoints and concerns
regarding this issue. I have marked a copy of this mail to students of the
department as well, in case anyone has some more points, suggestions to add.

Thanks and regards,
