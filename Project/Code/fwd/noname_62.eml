Distinguished Alumnus Award Recipient Seminar
Department of Computer Science

Speaker: Sridhar Ramaswamy, Senior VP, Google Inc.

Date: April 17, Thursday, Time: 2 p.m., Venue: CS 25

Title: F1: A Distributed Database That Scales.

Abstract: Conventional wisdom in computing is that high availability, scale
and query processing aren't simultaneously possible for database
applications. In this talk, I will talk about F1, a highly available,
disaster resistant database that also supports declarative query processing
at scale. This system supports one of the most critical databases at
Google: the ones used for ads data. My talk is based on the paper that was
presented in VLDB 2013.

Bio: Sridhar Ramaswamy serves as Senior Vice President of Ads & Commerce at
Google Inc. Since joining Google in 2003, Mr. Ramaswamy and his teams have
taken a lead role in defining the vision and direction of AdWords. Prior to
joining Google, he held several roles at E.piphany. He served as Director
of Engineering for E.piphany's Analytic Platform. Previously, he held
research positions at Bell Labs, Lucent Technologies and Bell
Communications Research (Bellcore). He has published numerous papers on
database systems and database theory. Mr. Ramaswamy earned a bachelor's
degree in computer science from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.
He received his Ph.D. and master's degree in computer science from Brown
University.
