Abstract:=20
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
An assessment-driven job marketplace could drive accountability in higher e=
ducation and meritocracy in labor markets. Towards this goal, we have condu=
cted over a million assessments of job candidates, matched candidates to jo=
bs based on them, and tracked their success. By mining this large-scale dat=
a, we learn how to make the employment ecosystem more efficient while disco=
vering heretofore unknown trends. WE will specifically discuss three exampl=
es of our work: discovery of pre-requisites required to learn computer prog=
ramming; discovery of factors (and biases) that lead to positive job outcom=
es; and identification of consistent behavioral markers for job failure.=20

For truly effective assessment driven marketplace, one needs to go beyond m=
ultiple-choice assessments. In the second part of the talk, we will discuss=
 how we do this using machine learning, focusing specifically on our recent=
 work in automatic grading of computer programs using a rich feature gramma=
r that captures local logic in a program. This work not only helps increase=
 companies' recruitment efficiency, but also helps students get feedback ab=
out their work, thereby helping to scale learning initiatives such as massi=
vely open online courses (MOOCs).=20

Speaker's bio:
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
Vinay Shashidhar=C2=A0is a senior research engineer at Aspiring Minds=E2=80=
=99 research group. He has worked on the design and implementation of multi=
ple products at Aspiring Minds in the domain of speech processing, personal=
ity instruments and question modeling. He was a core member of the research=
 team to develop SVAR, a spoken English evaluation tool. SVAR has been used=
 by corporations and institutions to test 750K+ candidates. He continues to=
 lead research to solve the problem of free speech evaluation with his team=
. He led the project on developing interpretable models based on test score=
s to predict job performance. The tool incorporated ideas from machine lear=
ning, evolutionary algorithms and multi-objective optimization. The tool ha=
s been deployed and been used by 60+ companies to develop their hiring crit=
eria. Vinay has filed 5 patents. In his spare time, he spends his efforts o=
n social initiatives in education and animal welfare.=20

Shashank Srikant=C2=A0is a research engineer at Aspiring Minds=E2=80=99 res=
earch group. His key work has been in developing automated programming eval=
uation methods. He has developed algorithms for performance assessment, mai=
ntainability and semantic assessment of written code. Apart from this, he h=
as been actively involved in developing simulation-based assessments for vo=
cational skills and has contributed to other product-development projects a=
t Aspiring Minds. He also leads research collaborations at Aspiring Minds. =
He has filed 3 patents and his work has been published/accepted at KDD and =
NIPS.=C2=A0He likes to be engaged in computer science/mathematics education=
 and keenly follows start-ups and pedagogy formulation

Aspiring Minds=C2=A0is=C2=A0a company founded by MIT-IIT alumni, which has =
grown to become India's largest employability assessments company. Through =
technology, we build systems to enable feedback, efficiency and meritocracy=
 in employment markets.
=C2=A0
The in-house research group focuses on building products in various domains=
 like program analysis, speech, crowd-sourcing, simulation and animation. A=
n instance where we use ML is to be able to predict, in a supervised manner=
, whether a student has written a logically/semantically correct computer p=
rogram. This helps scaling assessments required by a majority of IT-industr=
ies to hire programmers and does away with the perils of test-case based ev=
aluation. We also have a million data-points around student information and=
 are now visualizing, interpreting this data.

Currently, we have these systems in production which are utilized by an int=
ernational clientele. We have also published our work=C2=A0at NIPS, have go=
t IEEE Spectrum to cover our=C2=A0program-analysis work, had our work on pr=
ogramming assessments accepted at=C2=A0KDD 2014=C2=A0and are going to be or=
ganizing a workshop=C2=A0at KDD=C2=A0this year. We're also collaborating wi=
th groups from MIT, UIUC,=C2=A0Microsoft=C2=A0Research, Redmond and U.Water=
loo.
