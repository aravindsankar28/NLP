Dear All, 



Please find below the details of the talk by Dr. Sriram Rajamani, Microsoft Research, India. 

Venue: CS36 
Date: 19/8/2013 
Time: 9.00AM 

Title: Research in Programming 

Abstract: 
Most people think about programming as a routine implementation activity, primarily done in the industry, and primarily for economic gain. In this talk I will explain why the topic of programming is an important subject of research and scientific enquiry, with several interesting and hard questions such as: How do you write correct programs? How do you debug a large program? What does it take to program the cloud? How do you write programs that compute securely on the cloud? I will present some research projects at Microsoft Research India that aim to address some issues in these questions. 

About the speaker: 
Dr. Sriram Rajamani holds a PhD in Computer Science from the University of California at Berkeley. Currently, he is the assistant managing director of Microsoft Research India. More information on him can be found at:
