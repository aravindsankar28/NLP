Dear All, 
I am happy to invite all of you to my MS seminar on 19-Feb-2013 ( Tuesday ) at 2:00 PM . Kindly make it convenient to attend the seminar and give your valuable feedback. The details of the talk are as follows: 

Title: Delay and Power Modeling for Optimal Dynamic Supply and 
Body-bias Voltage Assignments for Nano-Scale CMOS Technologies 
Speaker: Virat Gandhi 
Guide: Prof. V. Kamakoti 
Date & Time: 19-Feb-2013 at 2:00 PM 
Venue: BSB 361, CSE Department 

Abstract: 
We developed novel analytical models for nano-scale CMOS technologies that yield accurate estimations of delay and power for multi-Vt designs in the presence of process-strength variations and temperature. These models are then applied to a post-layout ARM processor block implemented using mixed-Vt cells (SVT and LVT) running at 1.25Ghz with 28nm technology, and shown to have less than 3% RMS Error when compared with those, reported using detailed timing and power analysis tool. 
With the use of these models along with a standard optimizer, it is shown that the optimized supply and body-bias voltage assignment for the same design provides up to 40% (30%) run-time power reduction in the presence (absence) of on-chip temperature sensors when compared with ASV (a static process-strength aware adaptive supply voltage) conditions. A thermal-sensor feedback based dynamic supply and body-bias voltage assignment scheme is also applied to 3D CMPs and shown to have significant power reduction and peak temperature reduction. 

All are welcome!
