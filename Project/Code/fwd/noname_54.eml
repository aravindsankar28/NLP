Dear all,

I am presenting my  MS seminar talk on Tuesday, 22nd April, 2014 at 3:00 PM.
Kindly make it convenient to attend the seminar and give your valuable
suggestions.

The details of the talk are as follows.

Title                 :    Tackling Heavy Congestion in NoCs
Speaker            :    Prasanna Venkatesh R (CS11S019)
Date                 :    22nd April, 2014
Time                :     3.00 PM
Venue              :     BSB361, Seminar Hall, Department of Computer
Science

Abstract of the talk:
--------------------


We propose two novel methods of congestion control for network on chips
(NoCs).


Hotspot Awareness:


A hotspot is a type of network congestion. Adaptive NoCs should be able to
handle dynamic hotspots produced by multithreaded applications running in
multicore systems. The networks routers in multicore processors can be
completely unaware of the hotspots. This is because every router in a
network experience the presence/absence of hotspots different from other
routers.

This experience keeps changing with time. The intensity of a hotspot also
varies from router to router at a given time. Thus we can make a HotSpot
Aware router perform better by making them avoid the known hotspots. We
propose a technique, HSAware, to 1) learn hotspots dynamically at each
router. 2) We use the learnt data to throttle injections from a group of
nodes. This throttling mitigates the congestion caused by hotspots. And 3)
we resume injection when the learner realizes alleviation from hotspots.
HSAware makes the routers learn continuously, without incurring additional
clock delays or extra control information flow.


Multicast Optimizations:


Multithreaded workloads like SPLASH2 and PARSEC generate heavy network
traffic. This traffic consists of different packets injected by various
nodes at various points of time. A packet consists of three essential
components viz., source, destination and data. In this work, we study the
opportunity to increase the efficiency of the underlying network. We come
up with novel methods to share various components of the packets present in
a router at any time. We propose 1) dynamic multicast tree generation, 2)
critical word first at packet level, 3) making VC buffers act like cache
and 4) Packet Concatenation as NoC level optimizations.


We also evaluate the challenges and implementations in detail and compare
our gains over contemporary NoC optimization techniques for both the
proposed methods.

ALL ARE WELCOME

Thanks and Regards,
Prasanna Venkatesh R,
MS Scholar.
