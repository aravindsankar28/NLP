Dear Scholars 

Greetings. 

Coming Monday Nov 18 2013, we will be having a very informative presentation by 
Prashanth B (Computer Vision Lab) Titled "Do machines see the world the way we want them to see?" 

Abstract of his talk: 
Feature Descriptors (a.k.a "features" in the machine learning parlance) are 'the bread and butter' for representing images. 
Does this process of representation, per se, introduce unknown artifacts into the images that can potentially confuse an algorithm? 
This presentation will attempt to understand, on an introductory and intuitive level, why such (mis)representations occur by discussing a process known as inversion of features . 


Kindly make it convenient to attend this very informative presentation.
