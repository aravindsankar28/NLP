A gentle reminder!!

Dear all,

I am presenting my  MS seminar talk on Tuesday, 15th April, 2014 at 2:30
PM. Kindly make it convenient to attend the seminar and give your valuable
suggestions.

The details of the talk are as follows.

Title                 :    Relevance of Front-end Processing for Speaker
Recognition
Speaker            :    Asha T (CS11S026)
Date                 :    15th April, 2014
Time                :     2.30 PM
Venue              :     CS25, Seminar Hall, Department of Computer Science

Abstract of the talk:
--------------------

Speaker Verification (SV) is well-known pattern recognition task. Any
pattern recognition task involves feature extraction and building models,
which are further used in  classification.  In the recent literature of SV,
 modeling has received  focus by majority of the research community.
GMM-UBM framework is the conventional modeling framework used for SV while
i-vector or Total Variability Space (TVS) framework is the recent
state-of-the-art modeling framework. With the aim of establishing the
importance of feature extraction/front-end in comparison to modeling, an
optimisation experimental study at front-end level is taken up.   The
scalability of the optimised front-end  for different databases and current
state-of-the-art modeling framework is verified. This study led to
observations which question the relevance of NIST Speaker Recognition
Evaluations.

Feature Switching is a paradigm, where characteristic features of a class
are used in building its models.  This paradigm is already explored for
conventional GMM-UBM framework . As part of this work, it was extended to
i-vector framework. Also, singer identification is attempted for carnatic
music recordings by applying variety of features that are generally used
for speaker verification. Performance trends with different types of
features obtained are presented.

ALL ARE WELCOME

Thanks and Regards
