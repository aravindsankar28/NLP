Title:=20
Real-Time Scheduling on Heterogeneous Multicores=20


Abstract:=20
Parallel processing platforms are spreading at an unprecedented rate. Tradi=
tionally, parallel processing platforms were used to reduce the execution t=
ime of a large computational job such as predicting the weather but now the=
y are also used in low-end systems and embedded real-time systems thanks to=
 the availability of multicore processors. Specifically, heterogeneous mult=
icores now enjoy a period of widespread use since specialized processing un=
its in those multicores such as graphics processors, digital signal process=
ors, network processors, etc. offer a significant performance boost. All ma=
jor semiconductor companies are offering heterogeneous multicores, e.g., In=
tel Atom, AMD Fusion and NVIDIA Tegra. Although the processor cores in such=
 a heterogeneous multicore are different and each type offers its own disti=
nct advantage for various workloads, the trend is to make the processor cor=
es generic. For example, a graphics processor can be efficiently used (to o=
btain a good performance) for some computations that are not computer graph=
ics operations, such as sorting and numerical vector calculations. We can t=
herefore expect that the computational workhorse for both desktop and embed=
ded computer systems in the near future will be a heterogeneous multicore. =
Deploying embedded real-time systems on such heterogeneous multicores requi=
res development of real-time scheduling theory with provably good algorithm=
s. Hence, my PhD work aimed at developing provably good real-time schedulin=
g algorithms for heterogeneous multicores. This talk (i) will describe in d=
etail one such algorithm that works for two-type heterogeneous multicores i=
n which there are two distinct types of processors and (ii) will also provi=
de an overview of the other contributions of my dissertation work.=20
