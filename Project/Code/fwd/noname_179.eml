>>> Abstract: I will begin with a description of =93Embedded Systems=94. =
I will then briefly introduce the main areas of focus in my Ph.D., =
namely real-time systems, dynamic thermal management, SMT solvers for =
timing analysis, and automata interfaces for co-design of controllers =
and schedulers. I will then move on to the main topic of =93greedy =
processing=94. I will show that for a surprisingly large class of =
schedulers, where the timing behavior depends on state-ful properties =
such as on-chip temperature and battery fill level, greedy processing =
optimally minimizes the response time of jobs. This result simplifies =
efficient implementation of such schedulers. I will then discuss how =
this optimality property can be used to compute tight bounds on response =
times and other worst-case parameters by simulating a specific critical =
trace.
