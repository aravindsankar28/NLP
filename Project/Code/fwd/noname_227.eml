Topic: Routing Performance Modeling of DTNs Under Realistic Settings Using
Queueing Petri Nets
Venue: BSB 361, Dept. of CSE.

Abstract:

With the advancements in wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi Direct and
Near Field Communication, the infrastructure-less Peer-to-Peer content
sharing among mobile devices is becoming more popular. The potential
applications include Android Beam (a popular close proximity file
transferring protocol) and Bytewalla (a data connectivity project with the
idea of data mule, wherein the data is stored on a mobile node, that in
turn forwards to the destination via Internet on reaching an area with the
Internet connectivity). While such environments that are characterized by
disrupted and intermittent connections would impede the functioning of
conventional Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork (MANET) protocols, the Delay-Tolerant
Networks (DTNs) with their opportunistic message forwarding strategy could
be leveraged to provide seamless connectivity. The DTN routing protocols
circumvent intermittent connectivity using the store, carry, and forward
mechanism, wherein the nodes store messages locally and forward them upon
physically meeting the destination nodes (single-hop delivery), or any
other potential relay nodes that would reach the destination node in the
later time (i.e., multi-hop delivery). Considering the limited resources at
the mobile nodes, it becomes critical to study the routing performance of
DTNs as a function of physical parameters of the network and the nodes
involved. To the best of our knowledge, the performance modeling study of
the literature seldom considers the interplay of realistic factors such as
bundle fragmentation, buffer scheduling, and buffer spacing. In this work,
we look at Queueing Petri Nets (QPNs) as a modeling framework to study the
performance of the DTN routing under such realistic settings. To this end,
we propose QPN models of increasing complexity in an incremental fashion,
starting from a single-hop routing scheme to the multi-hop
replication-based routing protocols (namely (p,q)-epidemic routing). In the
process we also showcase, the analytical prowess of the QPN model, by
deriving the underlying reachability graph and constructing an equivalent
stochastic jump process. We validate our models with extensive simulation
results.

 ALL ARE WELCOME

Thanks and regards,
Mahendran. V
