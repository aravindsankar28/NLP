Title : Hardness of (2+eps)-SAT and Balanced Hypergraph Coloring<br>
Speaker : Dr. Venkatesan Guruswami (CMU, Pittsburgh, USA)<br>
Date &amp; TIme : Jul 31, 2014, Thursday, 2:30pm - 3:30pm.<br>
Venue : CS25<br>

Abstract:<br>
Given a k-SAT instance with the promise that there is an assignment<br>
satisfying at least t out of k literals in each clause, can one<br>
efficiently find a satisfying assignment (setting at least one literal<br>
to true in every clause)? The NP-hardness of 3-SAT implies that this<br>
problem is NP-hard when t &lt;=3D k/3, and extensions of some 2-SAT<br>
algorithms give efficient solutions when t &gt;=3D k/2.<br>
<br>
We prove that for t &lt; k/2, the problem is NP-hard. Thus,<br>
satisfiability becomes hard when the promised density of true literals<br>
falls below 1/2. One might thus say that the transition from easy to<br>
hard in 2-SAT vs. 3-SAT takes place just after two and not just before<br>
three.<br>
<br>
A strengthening of this result shows that given a (2k+1)-uniform<br>
hypergraph that can be 2-colored such that each edge has near-perfect<br>
balance (at most k+1 vertices of each color), it is NP-hard to even<br>
find a 2-coloring that avoids a monochromatic edge. This shows extreme<br>
hardness of discrepancy minimization for systems of bounded-size sets.<br>
<br>
The talk will sketch our proof of the SAT result, which is based on<br>
the fact that the only functions passing a natural ``dictatorship<br>
test&quot; are ``juntas&quot; depending on few variables. We might also bri=
efly<br>
mention the general principle (based on the lack of certain<br>
``polymorphisms&quot;) that underlies hardness of constraint satisfaction,<=
br>
and an improvement of the hypergraph coloring result (for 2k-uniform<br>
hypergraphs) ruling out coloring with any constant number of colors.<br>
<br>
Based on joint works with Per Austrin and Johan H=C3=A5stad<br>
