Dear All,

Prof. Prasad Jayanti (http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~prasad/) from
University of Dartmouth will be giving a talk at
tMeet(http://theory.cse.iitm.ac.in/tMeet.php) this week. Please find
below the details.
---------------------------------------------------
Title: Tight Time-Space Tradeoff for Mutual Exclusion
Speaker : Prasad Jayanti, University of Dartmouth
Date, Time, Venue : Aug 6, Tuesday, 4pm, CS36.
---------------------------------------------------
Abstract: Mutual Exclusion is a fundamental problem in distributed
computing. In the last two decades, there has been a great deal of
research on designing algorithms with small Remote Memory Reference
(RMR) complexity (the -RMR complexity measure- captures how well
concurrent algorithms perform on shared memory multiprocessors). In
this talk, I will show how RMR complexity trades off with space
complexity. Specifically I will show that, on cache coherent
multiprocessors, constant RMR complexity is impossible with
subpolynomial space and subpolynomial RMR complexity is impossible
with constant space. The proofs are fascinating and are done via a
purely combinatorial game that corresponds closely to mutual
exclusion.

(These results were presented at STOC 2012 and are joint work with
Nikhil Bansal, Vibhor Bhatt, and Ranganath Kondapally.)

All are welcome !.
