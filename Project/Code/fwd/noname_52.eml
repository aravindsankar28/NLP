Dear all,=20

I am presenting my Ph.D seminar talk on Tuesday , 6th May , 2014 at 3:30 PM=
 . Kindly make it convenient to attend the seminar and give your valuable s=
uggestions.=20

The details of the talk are as follows.=20


Title : Group Delay based Prominent Pitch Extraction from Polyphonic Music=
=20
Date : 6th May 2014=20
Time : 3.30 PM=20
Venue : BSB361, Seminar Hall, Department of Computer Science=20



Abstract of the talk:=20
--------------------=20



A novel phase based method for predominant melodic pitch extraction from po=
lyphonic music is proposed . The single (monophonic) pitch sequence that a =
listener might reproduce when asked to hum or whistle a polyphonic piece of=
 musi c is known as melody. In the proposed method, the power spectrum of t=
he music signal is first flattened in order to annihilate system characteri=
stics, while emphasising the source characteristics. The flattened magnitud=
e spectrum is treated as a time domain signal. The modified group delay fun=
ction of this signal produces peaks at multiples of the pitch period. The f=
irst three peaks are used to determine the actual pitch period. To address =
the effects of pitch doubling or halving, a dynamic programming based appro=
ach is used to ensure pitch continuity across frames and reduce errors. Dyn=
amic variation of pitch is captured by adaptive windowing in which the wind=
owsize is determined by fixing a static threshold on autocorrelation of Fou=
rier transform magnitude of frames with a lag. Voicing detection is perform=
ed using the normalized harmonic energy. The perfor-mance of the proposed s=
ystem was evaluated on five datasets:ADC-2004, LabROSA, MIREX-2008, MIR-1K =
and Carnatic dataset. The performance of the proposed phase based method is=
 comparable to that of other magnitude spectrum based methods=20
