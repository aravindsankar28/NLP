Dear All,

Prof. Srinivasan Parthasarathy from Ohio State University will be giving a
talk on Efficient Graph Clustering via Sparsification on Friday, 25th at 10
a.m. in CS25. All are welcome.

Regards

Ravi.

Title: Scalable Graph Clustering via Sparsification

Many real world problems (biological, social, web) can be effectively
modeled as networks or graphs where nodes represent entities of interest
and edges mimic the interactions or relationships among them. The study of
such complex relationship networks, recently referred to as "network
science", can provide insight into their structure, properties and emergent
behavior. Of particular interest here are rigorous methods for uncovering
and understanding important network structures and motifs (communities) at
multiple topological and temporal scales. Achieving this objective is
challenging due to the presence of noise (false or missing interactions),
topological (scale-free)) properties and scalability. Given the importance
of the graph clustering problem, a number of solutions ranging from
hierarchical methods to spectral methods have been designed and developed.

In this talk I will discuss a novel approach to sparsifying or sampling the
edges of a graph while retaining the relevant content and structure
important to motif and community detection. Empirical results demonstrate
both qualitative as well as quantitive improvements over existing
approaches on a wide range of datasets drawn from socio- technological- and
biological- domains. Time permitting, I will also illustrate the value of
such an approach from the perspective of visually teasing out relevant
structure from large scale graphs and networks.

Bio: Srinivasan Parthasarathy is a Professor in the Dept. of Computer
Science and Engineering and Department of Biomedical Informatics at the The
Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.

He heads the Data Mining Research Lab at OSU wherein his he primarily works
in data mining/machine learning and high performance computing and database
systems. His group develops efficient and novel algorithms for managing and
analyzing complex data. His current research is particularly motivated by
applications that arise in the area of network science specifically
biological networks and social networks. He is the recipient of numerous
honors such as the IBM Faculty Award, the OSU Lumley Research Award and the
Google Research Award to name a few
