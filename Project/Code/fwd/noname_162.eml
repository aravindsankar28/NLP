Abstract: In this talk, we study the spread of epidemics (infections) over =
large networks. In the first part, we study the scenario where the spread i=
s assisted by a small number of external agents: infection sources with bou=
nded spreading power, but whose movement is unrestricted with respect to th=
e underlying network topology. For networks which are =E2=80=98spatially co=
nstrained=E2=80=99 (e.g., random geometric graphs), we show that the spread=
 of infection can be significantly speeded up even by a few such agents inf=
ecting randomly. Further for such networks, we show that simple random, sta=
te-oblivious infection-spreading by an external agent is in fact order-wise=
 optimal for dissemination.=20

In the second part, we leverage the network propagation characteristics of =
epidemics to distinguish between epidemic spreading and "random" failures (=
e.g., flu vs. allergy, worm attack vs. random computer failures). For insta=
nce, a virus that spreads by taking advantage of physical links or user-acq=
uaintance links on a social network can grow explosively if it spreads beyo=
nd a critical radius. On the other hand, random infections (that do not tak=
e advantage of network structure) have very different propagation character=
istics. We address questions like: when can we distinguish between these me=
chanics of infection? Further, how can this be done efficiently? In this ta=
lk, we discuss sufficient conditions and algorithms for different graph top=
ologies, for when it is possible to distinguish between a random model of i=
nfection and a spreading epidemic model, with probability of misclassificat=
ion going to zero.=20
