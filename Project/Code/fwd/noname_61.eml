Dear All 

Please find the details of a talk on DRAM below. 

Title: Towards a Better DRAM Design 
Speaker: Vivek Seshadri 
Date and Time: 15th April 2014 (Tuesday), 11am 
Venue: BSB 361 

Vivek will be available for meeting with students/faculty from 1pm to 2:15pm. If you would like to meet him, please send me a note and I will reserve a room for meetings. 

Regards 
Shankar 
Abstract: 

In this talk, I will present some techniques to improve the performance and efficiency of DRAM-based memories. The talk consists of two parts. In the first part, I will present a tutorial on how DRAM is designed today. This should provide the necessary background for understanding the techniques presented in the second part. In the second part, I will present three techniques that improve the latency (Tiered-Latency DRAM), parallelism (Subarray-Level Parallelism) and bandwidth (RowClone) of DRAM. Our techniques require very few changes to existing DRAM design and hence, are low cost. 

Speaker Bio: 

Vivek Seshadri is a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University. He is advised by Prof. Todd C. Mowry and Prof. Onur Mutlu. His research interests include DRAM microarchitecture, cache management, and computer architecture/systems in general. He received his Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras in 2009.
