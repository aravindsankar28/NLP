Dear Scholars 


Greetings. 

The talk planned earlier which could not happen for multiple reasons will happen coming Monday 28 October 2013.. 

Please make it convenient to attend the upcoming Talk on 28st October 2013 3.00 PM 

Speaker: Aman Nougrahiya (PACE LAB) 
Title : Reducing Synchronization Primitives in OpenMP Programs 
Abstract : 
When multiple threads of execution run in parallel in shared-memory systems, synchronization primitives are required to ensure determinism and correctness of the output of applications. However, these synchronization primitives also introduce high performance costs that increase with the increase in the number of threads used. Unfortunately, many times this cost overshadows a considerable portion of the benefits obtained by parallelizing the applications, sometimes even contributing to the reasons why some parallel versions of the applications perform poorly as compared to the serial ones. 
In this talk, we'll discuss some of the central ideas used in the framework we are developing for reducing these synchronization primitives from OpenMP programs. 
This (not yet matured) framework is dependent on the concepts of code scheduling, memory renaming, and loop unrolling. 
Firstly, I'll try to present these ideas in the form of some short analogous stories from real life . 
Then, we'll look at some sample translations to better understand and discuss the proposed transformations. 

Please note the start time is 3 PM . This to enable there is sufficient time for the presentation and 
if some one wishes to attend the Extra Mural Lecture at CLT (4 PM the same day) they can do so as well. 

Kind regards 
Mani
