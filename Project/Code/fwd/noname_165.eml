> Bio:
> Krishna V. Palem is the Ken and Audrey Kennedy Professor at Rice
> University with appointments in Computer Science, in Electrical and
> Computer Engineering and in Statistics. He founded and directed the
> NTU-Rice Institute on Sustainable and Applied Infodynamics (ISAID),
> and is a scholar in the Baker Institute for Public Policy.
> Concurrently, he was a Nanyang Visiting Professor in the School of
> Physical and Mathematical Sciences at the Nanyang Technological
> University (NTU), Singapore. He was a Moore Distinguished Faculty
> Fellow at Caltech in 2006-2007, and a Schonbrunn Fellow at the Hebrew
> University of Jerusalem in 1999, where he was recognized for
> excellence in teaching. His advisee Suren Talla was awarded the Janet
> Fabri Prize for outstanding dissertation in 2001, and his related work
> on the foundations of architecture assembly for designing
> reconfigurable embedded SoC architectures, developed at Proceler Inc.
> which he co-founded and served as a CTO, was a nominee for the
> Analysts Choice Awards as one of the (four) outstanding technologies
> of 2002.
>=20
> More recently, he has pioneered a novel technology entitled
> Probabilistic CMOS (PCMOS) for enabling ultra low-energy embedded
> computing, with his students. In this context, his student Lakshmi
> Chakrapani's research was recognized through an outstanding
> dissertation award by Sigma Xi in 2008. PCMOS has also been recognized
> by a best-paper award at the IEEE-ACM CASES 2006 conference in Seoul,
> as one of the ten technologies 'likely to change the way we live' by
> MIT's Technology Review, and as one of the seven 'emerging world
> changing technologies' by IEEE as part of its 125th anniversary
> celebrations. Broadly, he has led efforts internationally in the area
> of embedded systems and their compiler optimizations, for which he has
> been named a Fellow of the IEEE, the ACM and AAAS. In 2012, Forbes
> (India) ranked him second on the list of eighteen scientists who are
> ``...some of the finest minds of Indian origin.=E2=80=9D He is the recipi=
