Dear All, 
this is not a crib or flame mail but I wish to point out that my talk was handled very poorly by the organizers . the change in time was not mentioned or not informed properly 
and many who wanted to attend missed the talk. 
I am aware i am no VIP but if you invite someone, then, a due respect should be given. I normally do not accept invitations in such events because technical talks by academics, that too by locals, will be least respected. Still, i thought i should give a try and did it and , as expected, participation even in a lesser event is more. it is not the number in the audience that bothered me but the general apathy of organizers on my talk did hurt me . Hope other technical talks went off well. 


Again, i want to clarify that this is not a flame mail. this is to point out a weak link in the organization of event. hope this feedback will help organizers of subsequent exhibits 
plan and coordinate the events better. no wonder nobody even mentions on the talk in any newsletter or other stuffs.. not even an acknowledgement!!!! In fact, I cut short a trip to accommodate the request of the students and readily agreed but it is clear that return of respect or honour was definitely missing.. 


cordially, 
CPR
