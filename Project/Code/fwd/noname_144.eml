Dear All,

PFB the details of a talk by Prof. Vijaykrishnan Narayanan, Penn State.

Title: Tearing down the power wall: Coordinated technology-architecture =
advances

Venue: BSB 361
Date: 22/8/2013
Time: 3:30PM

Abstract: This talk will highlight power-efficiency innovations driven =
by steep slope transistors and domain-specific customization. First, =
heterogeneous architectures that combine CMOS technology with Tunnel FET =
technology will be discussed. Second, domain specific accelerators for =
video analytic applications will be presented.
