Dear All, 

I will be giving my MS seminar talk on 6th August , 2013 ( Tuesday ) at 3:00 PM . I request you to kindly attend the seminar and give your valuable suggestions. The details of the talk are as follows: 

Speaker : Bhautik S Patel (CS10S002) 
Date : 6-08-2013, Tuesday 
Time : 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM 
Topic : Towards selective user specific query expansion 
Venue : BSB 361, Department of Computer Science & Engg. 
Guide : Dr.Sutanu Chakraborti 
: Dr.Ashish V Tendulkar 


Abstract: 

The World Wide Web (WWW) is a rich storehouse of heterogeneous information content such as text and multimedia data. The prevalent practice is that users need to specify their information requirements in terms of a query and use a search engine to obtain the desired information. These queries are usually short and ambiguous. Resolving an ambiguity is an important task in information retrieval. This ambiguity can be resolved effectively using query expansion. 

We attempt to make a consolidated study of the effectiveness of query logs in personalized query expansion and report empirical findings by analyzing the effect of personalization over anonymous query logs. We have designed a novel evaluation method to quantify improvements due to personalization. In the second part of our work, we present a novel approach to intelligently detect queries whose expansions may lead to improvements in retrieval. Empirical results obtained using this approach clearly show significant improvements over indiscriminate query expansion.
