>> Abstract:
>>=20
>> This talk focuses on techniques to improve the performance of =
applications in general, and HPC applications more specifically. At UNT, =
we have been developing simulators and tracing tools in order to =
identify performance bottlenecks and evaluate techniques for minimizing =
the impact of these bottlenecks. It is an understatement to say that the =
performance of multicore systems is limited by their memory systems=92 =
performance. Our research has developed both hardware and software =
solutions to improve the performance of cache memories, and how new =
memory technologies such as 3D stacked DRAMs, Phase Change Memories can =
be included in the memory hierarchies. Software solutions include =
profiling of data access patterns, relocating data, and restructuring =
code to improve performance. Hardware solutions include customizing =
cache address mapping (or indexing) for different threads and/or =
different objects within an application, simultaneous existence of =
multiple address mappings, eliminating unnecessary write-backs in memory =
hierarchy and better memory management. We are also evaluating our =
approaches in the context of emerging memory technologies including 3D =
DRAMs and non-volatile memories.

formal methods, parallel processing, and real-time systems. He published =
more than 150 technical papers in these areas. He received more than US =
$5 M in research grants. He graduated 14 PhDs and more than 35 MS =
students. He received his PhD from Southern Methodist University in =
Dallas Texas and a BS in EE from the Indian Institute of Science in =
Bangalore, India.
