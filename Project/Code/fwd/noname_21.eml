Title: Usability and Developability Challenges in Advanced Analytics 

Speaker: Arun Kumar, University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA 

Abstract: 

Advanced analytics is a booming area in the data management 
industry. As enterprise applications of statistical and machine 
learning techniques grow, many companies are racing to build analytics 
systems that combine such techniques with data management. From 
speaking to practitioners in diverse settings, we learned that two key 
challenges to widespread adoption of advanced analytics are the ease 
of usage and ease of development of analytics systems. In this talk, I 
will present an overview of my research that aims to tackle some 
usability and developability challenges in advanced analytics, while 
also ensuring scalability and high performance. I will talk about 
three systems that I have built as part of my research: (1) Staccato, 
which aims to make it easier for database administrators to query 
probabilistic OCR data, (2) Bismarck, which provides a unified 
abstraction that aims to make it easier for software engineers to 
integrate machine learning into an RDBMS, and (3) Columbus, which 
provides a declarative language that aims to make the task of feature 
selection easier for data analysts. Finally, I will talk briefly about 
some recent results and open research problems in the larger space of 
feature engineering, which is one of the most challenging bottlenecks 
in applying machine learning to real-world data. 

Bio: 

Arun Kumar is a PhD candidate in Computer Sciences at the University 
of Wisconsin-Madison. He received his B. Tech. in CSE from IIT Madras 
in 2009. His primary research interests are in data management, 
especially its intersection with machine learning. He is co-advised by 
professors Jeffrey Naughton and Jignesh Patel. Previously, he worked 
with professor Christopher Re. Systems and ideas from his research 
have been released as part of the MADlib open-source library and have 
been shipped with products from Oracle, IBM, EMC, and Cloudera. A 
paper on feature selection co-authored by him received the Best Paper 
Award at SIGMOD 2014.
