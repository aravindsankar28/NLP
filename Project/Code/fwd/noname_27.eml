Title : Hardness of (2+eps)-SAT and Balanced Hypergraph Coloring
Speaker : Dr. Venkatesan Guruswami (CMU, Pittsburgh, USA)
Date & TIme : Jul 31, 2014, Thursday, 2:30pm - 3:30pm.
Venue : CS25

Abstract:
Given a k-SAT instance with the promise that there is an assignment
satisfying at least t out of k literals in each clause, can one
efficiently find a satisfying assignment (setting at least one literal
to true in every clause)? The NP-hardness of 3-SAT implies that this
problem is NP-hard when t <=3D k/3, and extensions of some 2-SAT
algorithms give efficient solutions when t >=3D k/2.

We prove that for t < k/2, the problem is NP-hard. Thus,
satisfiability becomes hard when the promised density of true literals
falls below 1/2. One might thus say that the transition from easy to
hard in 2-SAT vs. 3-SAT takes place just after two and not just before
three.

A strengthening of this result shows that given a (2k+1)-uniform
hypergraph that can be 2-colored such that each edge has near-perfect
balance (at most k+1 vertices of each color), it is NP-hard to even
find a 2-coloring that avoids a monochromatic edge. This shows extreme
hardness of discrepancy minimization for systems of bounded-size sets.

The talk will sketch our proof of the SAT result, which is based on
the fact that the only functions passing a natural ``dictatorship
test" are ``juntas" depending on few variables. We might also briefly
mention the general principle (based on the lack of certain
``polymorphisms") that underlies hardness of constraint satisfaction,
and an improvement of the hypergraph coloring result (for 2k-uniform
hypergraphs) ruling out coloring with any constant number of colors.

Based on joint works with Per Austrin and Johan H=C3=A5stad
(http://eccc.hpi-web.de/report/2013/159/) and Euiwoong Lee
(http://eccc.hpi-web.de/report/2014/043/)
