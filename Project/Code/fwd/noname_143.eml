Dear All, 


Dr. Praveen Jayachandran (DD-CSE-05), from IBM-IRL, will be giving a talk on Shared Dynamic Clouds at 2 p.m. on Friday 23rd, in BSB 361. 
Details below. All are welcome. 


Regards 
Ravi. 

Title: Problem Determination and Diagnosis in Shared Dynamic Clouds 

Abstract: 
The first part of the talk will provide a brief overview of cloud computing 
and virtualization concepts, so that 1st/2nd year B.Tech students 
and those not familiar with the area can follow the talk without too much 
difficulty. The second part of the talk will focus on our work in 
addressing the problem of detecting and diagnosing performance anomalies in 
virtualized clouds. We show that high dynamism, resource sharing, 
frequent reconfiguration, high propensity to faults and automated 
management introduce significant new challenges towards 
fault diagnosis in clouds. Towards this, we propose CloudPD, a fault 
management framework for clouds. CloudPD leverages 
(i) a canonical representation of the operating environment to quantify the 
impact of sharing; (ii) an online learning process to 
tackle dynamism; (iii) a correlation-based performance models for higher 
detection accuracy; and (iv) an integrated end-to-end 
feedback loop to synergize with a cloud management ecosystem. A prototype 
implementation with cloud representative batch 
and transactional workloads like Hadoop, Olio and RUBiS, was developed to 
demonstrate the effectiveness of CloudPD 
in diagnosing anomalies in real-life operations. 

Bio: 
Praveen Jayachandran is a research staff member of the distributed systems 
team at IBM Research, India. His research interests are in the 
area of cloud computing and in the analysis, performance management, and 
optimization of distributed systems and networks. He received 
his PhD from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2010, and a 
B.Tech-M.Tech dual degree in Computer Science from the 
Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. He is the recipient of the best 
paper award at ECRTS 2009 and the best student paper award at 
ECRTS 2007. He also received the Feng Chen Memorial award in 2010 and the 
C.L. and Jane Liu award in 2008, both from the Department 
of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
