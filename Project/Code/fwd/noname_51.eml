Abstract:=20

Many decades after quantum mechanics was accepted as a more accurate model =
of the physical world, Richard Feynman proposed the brilliant vision of bui=
lding computers based on quantum mechanical systems in 1981. The two major =
drivers for the development in this =EF=AC=81eld are the need to overcome t=
he limitations both in the theory of computing with classical deterministic=
 digital computing models and in the technology of building them. With a br=
ief introduction to the motivation for quantum computing, we will discuss t=
he basic model and the operations. Notwithstanding the limitations in physi=
cal realizations, there has been progress in the technology of quantum comp=
uters during the last quarter of a century. The main focus of this talk is =
on reliable synthesis methods for quantum computers starting with a set of =
fundamental quantum gates realizable in the existing technologies.=20

Brief Bio:=20

Susmita Sur-Kolay is presently a Professor in the Advanced Computing and Mi=
croelectronics Unit of the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India. He=
r research contributions are in the areas of algorithms for design automati=
on, Intellectual Property protection of electronic design, synthesis of qua=
ntum computers, graph algorithms. She has authored several technical papers=
 in international journals and refereed conference proceedings and a chapte=
r in the Handbook on Algorithms for VLSI Physical Design Automation. She ha=
s served on the program committees of many international conferences and wa=
s the Technical Program Co-Chair for three of them. She is an Associate Edi=
tor of ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems and was on the editor=
ial board of Proc. of IEE CDT and IEEE Transactions on VLSI Systems. She wa=
s a Distinguished Visitor of IEEE Computer Society(India), is a Senior Memb=
er of IEEE, and Member of ACM. Two papers co-authored by her won best paper=
 awards at two international conferences. Among other awards, she was the r=
ecipient of the President of India Gold Medal at IIT Kharagpur and IBM Facu=
lty Award.=20
