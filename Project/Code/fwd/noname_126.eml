Abstract=20
**************************************************=20

3D shape analysis is an extremely active research topic in both computer gr=
aphics and computer vision. In computer vision, 3D shape acquisition and mo=
delling are generally the result of complex data processing and data analys=
is methods. There are many practical situations where a visual shape is mod=
elled by a point cloud observed with a variety of 2D and 3D sensors. Unlike=
 the graphical data, the sensory data are not, in the general case, uniform=
ly distributed across the surfaces of the observed objects and they are oft=
en corrupted by sensor noise, outliers, surface properties (scattering, spe=
cularities, color, etc.), self-occlusions, varying lighting conditions. Mor=
eover, the same object that is observed by different sensors, from slightly=
 different viewpoints, or at different time instances may yield completely =
different point distributions, noise levels and, most notably, topological =
differences, e.g., merging of hands. In this talk, we will discuss the outl=
ine of single and multi-scale representation for articulated 3D shapes and =
new shape analysis methods proposed, keeping in mind the challenges posed b=
y visual shape data. First, we will introduce pose-invariant spectral embed=
ding representation and heat diffusion framework for multi-scale shape repr=
esentation. Next, we will present the proposed solutions for shape segmenta=
tion and dense shape registration using the spectral graph methods and vari=
ous other machine learning algorithms, namely, the Gaussian Mixture Model (=
GMM) and the Expectation Maximization (EM). Finally, we present topological=
ly-robust dense shape matching results by proposed method.=20
