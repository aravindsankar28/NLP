Hi all, 

I do understand that everybody is a bit busy these days with winding up the semester. However, there is a very nice talk tomorrow by Dr. Umang Bhaskar. 

Venue: CS 25 (NOT BSB 361 as there are AC issues). 
Time: 10:50AM for tea/coffee. The talk will start at 11.
Date: Nov 29, 2013.

Just wanted to remind you all regarding this.

Regards,
John.

> Title: Network Improvement for Equilibrium Routing
> 
> Abstract:
> 
> In many diverse applications, users strategically choose routes in a
> network to minimize the delay they face. Examples of such applications
> are road traffic, data networks, and cloud computing marketplaces.
> Routing games model this strategic behaviour of the users, and are
> used to understand and predict the impact of this behaviour on the
> traffic and delays in the network.
> 
> We consider a fundamental problem facing the manager of such a
> network: to make improvements to the network under a fixed budget, so
> that the average delay for the strategic users is minimized. The
> problem is modeled using routing games and widely studied in
> transportation research. However, despite its practical relevance,
> there are no proven guarantees for polynomial-time algorithms. In this
> talk, I will present both algorithms and hardness results for network
> improvement in a number of different network topologies, and describe
> a number of related problems as directions for future research.
> 
> This is joint work with Katrina Ligett and Leonard Schulman.
