Dear All,

Dr. Partha Talukdar is a faculty at IISc, SERC. He is a very well known
name in the field of learning on graphs. He will be visiting the CSE
Department on Friday the 21st. He is giving a talk at 11 a.m. in BSB 361.
Details below. All are welcome.

If any one is interested in a one-on-one meeting with him, please let me
know. Partha is here till late in the evening. There will be an interaction
with students organized in the afternoon.

This talk is supported partly by Yahoo! labs.

Regards
Ravi.

Coords: Friday, 21st, 11 a.m., BSB 361.

Title: Graph-based methods for Web-scale Knowledge Harvesting
Abstract: Harvesting knowledge from web-scale text datasets has emerged as
an interesting and promising area of research over the last few years,
resulting in the construction of several large knowledge bases (KBs).
Graphs provide a natural way to organize such harvested knowledge.
Moreover, graph-based learning and inference methods have proved to be
effective in the construction of such KBs. In this talk, I shall present an
overview of my research in this area, with examples and applications of
techniques ranging from graph-based semi-supervised learning to random walk
inference over knowledge graphs.
