I am presenting my PhD Seminar talk on 10th May 2013. In this regard , I ki=
ndly solicit your presence and valuable suggestions. The details of the tal=

Abstract:=20

At present Internet is a country=E2=80=99s predominant and viable data comm=
unication infras-=20
tructure. Autonomous System (AS) topology occupies the top position in the =
Internet=20
infrastructure hierarchy. The AS resources which are building blocks of the=
 topology=20
such as AS numbers, IPv4 and IPv6 Prefixes are globally competitive because=
 of the=20
finite resource pool. The resource requirement for each country is dynamic =
and driven=20
by various technical and socio-economic factors. Hence to acquire the resou=
rces, plan=20
for future expansions and make policies there is a need for forecasting. In=
 addition to=20
this, understanding on long term trend and stochastic variation behaviour a=
re essential=20
to detect significant events in the growth. Time series based approximation=
 is explored=20
for mathematical modeling, system identification and forecast the yearly AS=
 growth.=20
The empirical evaluation performed on AS data extracted from APNIC archive =
for five=20
countries namely India, China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan has exhibited =
two signif-=20
icant temporal patterns. In the study, two countries from larger economies =
and three countries=20
from advanced technology nations in the APNIC region are considered for ana=
lysis. The=20
characterization of the time series is performed for long term growth rate =
and trend=20
direction. The statistically significant difference in long term trends bet=
ween technology=20
advanced countries and larger economies is established through hypothesis t=
esting. The=20
significant variations in the Inter Annual Absolute Variations (IAAV) of AS=
 growth are iden-=20
tified using change point detection method. The correlation between IAAV an=
d Gross=20
Domestic Product (GDP) hints that the growth in service sector Industry is =
the driving=20
force behind significant variations in AS growth from 2007 onwards. The lev=
el change in=20
variations, positive growth percentage in IAAV and higher percentage of adv=
ertised ASes=20
when compared to other countries indicate India=E2=80=99s fast growth in In=
ternet Infrastructure=20
from 2007 onwards.=20
