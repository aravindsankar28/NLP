Abstract:=20

Degree sequence of a graph is defined as a sequence whose elements are the =
degrees of all the vertices in the graph, and if we form a set correspondin=
g to the given degree sequence we get a degree set. They give an another wa=
y of representing graphs(simple),=20
using O(|V |log|V |) space, but at the cost of loosing their uniqueness. Du=
e to Kapoor et al, we know that any set S =3D {a_1 < =C2=B7 =C2=B7 =C2=B7 <=
 a_n}, of positive integers is always realizable by a simple graph with a_n=
 + 1 vertices. Here the interesting question is: Can we realize S by a simp=
le graph with exactly r (a_n+1) vertices? We have answered this in a positi=
ve way. Amazingly if we ask the same question for tree realizability (a_1 =
=3D 1) of S, then we found the problem to be NP-Complete. With the same mot=
ivation, we extended the degree set definition to digraphs(simple) under di=
fferent realizibility notions, and showed that any set, S =3D {a_1 < =C2=B7=
 =C2=B7 =C2=B7 < a_n}, of positive integers can always be realized by an as=
ymmetric graph with exactly r vertices. Even for directed trees, such exten=
sions are always possible. We will also discuss about multiplicity-constrai=
ned degree sets, an intermediate case between degree sets and degree sequen=
ces, where we restrict the number of times that a vertex in the degree set =
appears in the realization. In this direction, we particularly focus on the=
 tree-realizability of degree sets under multiplicity constraints on each d=
egree.=20

All are welcome!=20
