Title : Deterministic Fully Dynamic Data Structures for Vertex Cover and
Matching.
Speaker : Sayan Bhattacharya, IMSc, Chennai
Date, Time & Venue : Tue, Nov 18, 2014, 2:00 PM - BSB 361

[Abstract]
We present the first deterministic data structures for maintaining
approximate minimum vertex cover and maximum matching in a fully dynamic
graph in $o(sqrt{m})$ time per update. In particular, for minimum vertex
cover we provide deterministic data structures for maintaining a
$(2+epsilon)$ approximation in $O(log n/epsilon^2)$ amortized time per
update. For maximum matching, we show how to maintain a $(3+epsilon)$
approximation in $O(m^{1/3}/epsilon^2)$ {em amortized} time per update, and
a $(4+epsilon)$ approximation in $O(m^{1/3}/epsilon^2)$ {em worst-case}
time per update. Our data structure for fully dynamic minimum vertex cover
is essentially near-optimal and settles an open problem by Onak and
Rubinfeld~cite{OnakR10}.
