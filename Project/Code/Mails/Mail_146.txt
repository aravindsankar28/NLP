Dear Colleagues and Students:

I am organizing a technical talk by Dr C Mohan, IBM Fellow, on 22nd Feb,
Friday at 2PM in CS24 or CS25. The details of the talk are below.
Dr C Mohan is a very accomplished person in the Database Systems world and
an alumnus of Chemical Engineering of IITM.

In this talk, I will describe some of the recent developments in the
database management area, in particular the NoSQL phenomenon and the hoopla
associated with it. The goal of the talk is not to do an exhaustive survey
of NoSQL systems. The aim is to do a broad brush analysis of what these
developments mean - the good and the bad aspects! Based on my more than
three decades of database systems work in the research and product arenas,
I will outline what are many of the pitfalls to avoid since there is
currently a mad rush to develop and adopt a plethora of NoSQL systems in a
segment of the IT population, including the research community. In rushing
to develop these systems to overcome some of the shortcomings of the
relational systems, many good principles of the latter, which go beyond the
relational model and the SQL language, have been left by the wayside. Now
many of the features that were initially discarded as unnecessary in the
NoSQL systems are being brought in, but unfortunately in ad hoc ways.
Hopefully, the lessons learnt over three decades with relational and other
systems would not go to waste and we wouldn=92t let history repeat itself
with respect to simple minded approaches leading to enormous pain later on
for developers as well as users of the NoSQL systems! This talk would be
delivered as an Invited Keynote at the 16th International Conference in
Extending Database Technology in Genoa (Italy) in March 2013. The basis for
it is the paper at http://bit.ly/NoSQLp
