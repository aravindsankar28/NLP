), was

nings

ve

> substantially extending the time when we would encounter the dreaded
> cliff-edge, if not avoid it altogether. When faced with this issue, I
> decided to consider a different approach=E2=80=94one which suggested fall=
ing

> manner. This would result in devices that could switch and produce
> bits that are correct, namely have the intended value, only with a
> probabilistic guarantee. As a result, the results could in fact be
> incorrect. Such devices and associated circuits and computing
> structures are now broadly referred to as inexact designs, circuits
> and architectures. In this talk, I will start with the beginnings of
> this idea in 2002=E2=80=94one that Technology Review labeled as being
> heretical in their TR10 citation=E2=80=94and give an overview of a range =
of
> ideas that my students and other groups around the world have been
> developing since, that embody inexact computing today. Despite being
> probabilistic, inexact designs can be significantly more efficient in
> the energy they consume, their speed of execution and area needs,
> which makes them attractive for resilient applications which can
> tolerate error. I will also contrast this style of design with
> traditional approaches with a rich history, aimed at realizing
> reliable computing from unreliable elements, starting with von
> Neumann=E2=80=99s influential lectures and further developed elegantly by
> Shannon-Weaver and others.

> Bio:
> Krishna V. Palem is the Ken and Audrey Kennedy Professor at Rice
> University with appointments in Computer Science, in Electrical and
> Computer Engineering and in Statistics. He founded and directed the
> NTU-Rice Institute on Sustainable and Applied Infodynamics (ISAID),
> and is a scholar in the Baker Institute for Public Policy.
> Concurrently, he was a Nanyang Visiting Professor in the School of
> Physical and Mathematical Sciences at the Nanyang Technological
> University (NTU), Singapore. He was a Moore Distinguished Faculty
> Fellow at Caltech in 2006-2007, and a Schonbrunn Fellow at the Hebrew
> University of Jerusalem in 1999, where he was recognized for
> excellence in teaching. His advisee Suren Talla was awarded the Janet
> Fabri Prize for outstanding dissertation in 2001, and his related work
> on the foundations of architecture assembly for designing
> reconfigurable embedded SoC architectures, developed at Proceler Inc.
> which he co-founded and served as a CTO, was a nominee for the
> Analysts Choice Awards as one of the (four) outstanding technologies
> of 2002.
>=20
> More recently, he has pioneered a novel technology entitled
> Probabilistic CMOS (PCMOS) for enabling ultra low-energy embedded
> computing, with his students. In this context, his student Lakshmi
> Chakrapani's research was recognized through an outstanding
> dissertation award by Sigma Xi in 2008. PCMOS has also been recognized
> by a best-paper award at the IEEE-ACM CASES 2006 conference in Seoul,
> as one of the ten technologies 'likely to change the way we live' by
> MIT's Technology Review, and as one of the seven 'emerging world
> changing technologies' by IEEE as part of its 125th anniversary
> celebrations. Broadly, he has led efforts internationally in the area
> of embedded systems and their compiler optimizations, for which he has
> been named a Fellow of the IEEE, the ACM and AAAS. In 2012, Forbes
> (India) ranked him second on the list of eighteen scientists who are
> ``...some of the finest minds of Indian origin.=E2=80=9D He is the recipi=
ent
> of the 2008 W. Wallace McDowell Award, IEEE Computer Society's highest
> technical award and one of computing's most prestigious individual
