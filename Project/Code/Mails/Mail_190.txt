Abstract of the talk:=20

A novel phase based method for predominant melodic pitch extraction from po=
lyphonic music is proposed . The single (monophonic) pitch sequence that a =
listener might reproduce when asked to hum or whistle a polyphonic piece of=
 musi c is known as melody. In the proposed method, the power spectrum of t=
he music signal is first flattened in order to annihilate system characteri=
stics, while emphasising the source characteristics. The flattened magnitud=
e spectrum is treated as a time domain signal. The modified group delay fun=
ction of this signal produces peaks at multiples of the pitch period. The f=
irst three peaks are used to determine the actual pitch period. To address =
the effects of pitch doubling or halving, a dynamic programming based appro=
ach is used to ensure pitch continuity across frames and reduce errors. Dyn=
amic variation of pitch is captured by adaptive windowing in which the wind=
owsize is determined by fixing a static threshold on autocorrelation of Fou=
rier transform magnitude of frames with a lag. Voicing detection is perform=
ed using the normalized harmonic energy. The perfor-mance of the proposed s=
ystem was evaluated on five datasets:ADC-2004, LabROSA, MIREX-2008, MIR-1K =
and Carnatic dataset. The performance of the proposed phase based method is=
 comparable to that of other magnitude spectrum based methods=20
