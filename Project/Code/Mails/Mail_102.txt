Abstract:=20

Automatic detection and correction of grammatical errors in a morphological=
ly rich and free word order language like Bangla is a non trivial task. The=
 problem is to automatically detect and correct errors in an ungrammatical =
Bangla sentence having postpositional and nominal inflectional errors. A me=
thodology needs to be devised for correcting the mistakes committed by user=
s and also to provide relevant examples for supporting the suggested correc=
tion. To have an idea on how strongly we can rely on such a correction, it =
will be useful to devise a measure of sentence complexity with respect to t=
he grammar correction task. If a sentence is complex, the user should not b=
e overtly reliant on the correction suggested by the system. Conversely if =
the complexity measure is low, the user can confidently choose the suggesti=
on.=20

=C2=A0A sufficiently large number of error corpus is essential for training=
 and testing of any grammar correction methodology. Manual collection of su=
ch huge error corpora is a tedious and time consuming task. Therefore, a no=
vel synthetic error corpora creation methodology has been proposed. This ha=
s been done using a combination of confidence score estimator and mal-rule =
filter to introduce errors into a corpus of correct text. A novel approach =
has been proposed for automatic detection and correction of Bangla grammati=
cal errors using a Natural Language Generation (NLG) technique. Our NLG bas=
ed grammar correction approach follows lemmatization, over generation, prun=
ing of search space and best path selection procedures. In order to ensure =
that the suggested correction is not too divergent from the source erroneou=
s sentence, the WER and BLEU score have been used. The proposed approach al=
so estimates the complexity of the grammar correction task so that the user=
 can be informed about the system=E2=80=99s confidence. An active learning =
based complexity estimation has been used to estimate the complexity of gra=
mmar correction. Evaluation of grammar correction system is one of the chal=
lenges in this area of research. Performance of most of the available gramm=
ar checker systems cannot be compared as different systems address differen=
t types of errors. Moreover, systems are not tested on common data set. Tes=
ting on a common data set is particularly problematic when different gramma=
r checkers are designed for different languages. To circumvent these proble=
ms, a Methodology for Evaluation of Grammar Assessment (MEGA) combining a G=
raded Acceptability Assessment Metric (GAAM) and a Complexity Measurement M=
etric (CMM) has been introduced.=20
