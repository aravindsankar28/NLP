Dear students, 


I just came to know that many of you were under the impression that the computational geometry course (Aug - Dec, 2013) will be in the D slot (overlapping with a core course). Let me correct this. The course will be offered instead in the E slot. Computational geometry deals with algorithms on geometric data. The course will mostly be a textbook-based course with theory assignments. Please talk to me if you are interested. A good grade (A or S) in Data structures and Algorithms is essential for you to do well in this course. 


Regards, 
John.
