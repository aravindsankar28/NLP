Abstract: 



In 1994, Peter Shor showed that prime factorization and discrete logarithms problem can be solved in polynomial time on a quantum computer. In other words, once quantum computer becomes a reality all of the public-key algorithms used to protect the Internet will be broken. It facilitated research on new cryptosystems that are secure from quantum computers, collectively called post-quantum cryptography. Lattice based problems are conjectured to be secure against classical computers as well as quantum computers. Besides being a strong candidate for post-quantum cryptography, Lattice based schemes are relatively efficient implementations, simple and provide strong security guarantee. 

Threshold public key encryption is a cryptographic primitive where a secret key of an organization is distributed among special members called decryption servers (insiders) and a certain threshold number of insiders must cooperate to decrypt any ciphertext. 

In this seminar, we will combine these two primitives and construct the lattice based threshold public key encryption scheme.
