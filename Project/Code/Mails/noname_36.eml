Title: Elementary Estimators for High-dimensional Statistical Models

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning high-dimensional statistical
models, where the number of variables could be even larger than the number
of observations. This class of problems has attracted considerable
attention in statistical machine learning over the last decade, with state
of the art statistical estimators based on solving regularized convex
programs. Scaling these typically non-smooth convex programs to the very
large-scale problems of the Big Data era comprises an ongoing and rich area
of research.
In contrast to this two-stage approach of first devising statistically
efficient estimators, and then devising computationally efficient
optimization methods to solve these estimators, we attempt to address this
scaling issue at the source, by asking whether one can build simpler
closed-form estimators, that yet come with statistical guarantees that are
nonetheless comparable to regularized likelihood estimators. Surprisingly,
we are able to answer this question in the affirmative. We analyze our
estimators in the high-dimensional setting, and moreover provide empirical
corroboration of our statistical and computational performance guarantees.
