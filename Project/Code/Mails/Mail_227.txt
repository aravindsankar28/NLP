Title: "Using Linear Algebra to Solve Polynomial Systems" 

Abstract:
"In many applications of computer algebra, the task arises
to solve polynomial systems of equations which are known to have
only finitely many solutions. Algebraically, such systems correspond
to algebras which are finite dimensional vector spaces over a field.
Given a basis of such an algebra and its description by multiplication
matrices, we show how one can use methods of Linear Algebra to 
determine the set of solutions of the polynomial system.
We shall also discuss applications of polynomial system solving to
cryptography and to industrial applications."

SEMINAR 2

Speaker: Prof. Martin Kreuzer, University of Passau, Germany.
Venue : CS 25, Computer Sciences Block
Date and Time: 30/1/2014, Thursday, at 11AM (1 hour)
Title: "Chess and Mathematics" 

"In this talk we explore the connections between the game of chess
and mathematics on a number of different levels: chess players and
mathematicians, combinatorial chess problems, chess and logic,
algorithms for playing chess, and programs for solving chess
completely. Contrary to popular belief we shall indicate that, while 
there are indeed strong connections between chess problems and 
math problems, the number of persons who are experts in both fields
is surprisingly small. On the other hand, the tasks of implementing
strong chess playing programs and programs for analyzing endgame
positions have strongly influenced the development of computer
science and algorithmics."
