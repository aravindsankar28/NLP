Dear All, 
I was supposed to give my first PhD seminar today. Due to some mistake (from my side), announcement of my PhD seminar was not posted to the campus news. So my first PhD seminar is postponed to some other date (announced later). 
I sincerely apologize for my mistake. 

Thanks, 



With regards,

Dear All, 

I am happy to invite you all for my first PhD seminar talk on Tuesday , 25 th February, 2014 at BSB 361. Please make it convenient to attend the seminar and give your valuable suggestions. 

The details of the seminar are as follows: 

Topic : Lattice based threshold public key encryption scheme 

Date : 25 th February , 2014 
Time : 15:00 - 16:00 Hrs 
Venue : BSB 361, Seminar Hall, Department of Computer Science and Engineering 



Abstract: 



In 1994, Peter Shor showed that prime factorization and discrete logarithms problem can be solved in polynomial time on a quantum computer. In other words, once quantum computer comes into reality all of the public-key algorithms used to protect the Internet will be broken. It facilitated research on new cryptosystems that are secure from quantum computers, collectively called post-quantum cryptography. Lattice based problems are conjectured to be secure against classical computers as well as quantum computers. Besides being a strong candidate for post-quantum cryptography, Lattice based schemes are relatively efficient implementations, simple and provide strong security guarantee. 

Threshold public key encryption is a cryptographic primitive where a secret key of an organization is distributed among special members called decryption servers (insiders) and a certain threshold number of insiders must cooperate to decrypt any ciphertext. 

In this seminar, we will combine these two primitives and construct the lattice based threshold public key encryption scheme. 




All are Welcome.
