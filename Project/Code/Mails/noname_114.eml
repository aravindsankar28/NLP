Dear Scholars, 

Next Thursday there will be DCC meeting, where I have to put forward issues and concerns from the scholars side. In one of my last mail I proposed that we can have a discussion among ourselves regarding the points to be discussed there. 

Can we have a small meeting on this just before Dileep's talk? I will be there at 3 PM in RSB. If anyone of you want to raise some issue to be discussed in the forthcoming DCC meeting please feel free to come and tell the same to me. I will take it to the committee. 

Regards, 

Joy
