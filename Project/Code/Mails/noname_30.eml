Abstract=20


A Graph is chordal if every cycle of length greater than three has a chord.=
 Chord is an edge joining two non adjacent vertices. We present a distance =
oracle for chordal graphs. Distance oracle is a data structure that stores =
information of the distance between vertices of a graph.=20


Given a chordal graph G on n vertices we preprocess it in O(n^2) time and s=
pace to build a data structure of size O(n) such that any subsequent distan=
ce query can be answered in constant time with a bounded constant factor er=
ror. In particular, for each pair of vertices u,v in V(G), we output a dist=
ance value d <=3D d_G(u,v) + 11, where d_G(u,v) is the distance between u a=
nd v in G. In contrast, for the closely related APSP problem on chordal gra=
phs, the current best algorithm runs in O(n^2.376) time. Our improvement co=
mes from a relationship that we discover between the graph distance and min=
imum hitting sets of cliques on certain paths in a clique tree associated w=
ith a chordal graph. We then design an efficient data structure to additive=
ly approximate (error of +3) these minimum hitting sets of cliques for all =
paths in the clique tree. These are then integrated with an efficient data =
structure to answer LCA queries in rooted trees to yield our distance oracl=
e for a given chordal graph.=20




Chordal graphs are often represented by its Clique Tree in very compact and=
 efficient manner. Clique tree is a structure that contains most of the inf=
ormation of the associated chordal graph. We exploit the structural propert=
ies of the clique tree to extract the distance information of the associate=
d chordal graph. We keep this information in a data structure that can answ=
er any query of distance between any pair of vertices of graph in constant =
time. The most impressive feature of our data structure is its constant que=
ry time in spite of the fact that it uses only linear space, i.e., it does =
not store distance between all the pairs of vertices explicitly.=20
