A gentle reminder.... 



Dear All, 


Dr. Praveen Jayachandran (DD-CSE-05), from IBM-IRL, will be giving a talk on Shared Dynamic Clouds at 2 p.m. on Friday 23rd, in BSB 361. 
Details below. All are welcome. 


Regards 
Ravi. 

Title: Problem Determination and Diagnosis in Shared Dynamic Clouds 

Abstract: 
The first part of the talk will provide a brief overview of cloud computing 
and virtualization concepts, so that 1st/2nd year B.Tech students 
and those not familiar with the area can follow the talk without too much 
difficulty. The second part of the talk will focus on our work in 
addressing the problem of detecting and diagnosing performance anomalies in 
virtualized clouds. We show that high dynamism, resource sharing, 
frequent reconfiguration, high propensity to faults and automated 
management introduce significant new challenges towards 
fault diagnosis in clouds. Towards this, we propose CloudPD, a fault 
management framework for clouds. CloudPD leverages 
(i) a canonical representation of the operating environment to quantify the 
impact of sharing; (ii) an online learning process to 
tackle dynamism; (iii) a correlation-based performance models for higher 
detection accuracy; and (iv) an integrated end-to-end 
feedback loop to synergize with a cloud management ecosystem. A prototype 
implementation with cloud representative batch 
and transactional workloads like Hadoop, Olio and RUBiS, was developed to 
demonstrate the effectiveness of CloudPD 
in diagnosing anomalies in real-life operations.
