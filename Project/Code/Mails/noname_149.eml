Title: Research in Programming 

Abstract: 
Most people think about programming as a routine implementation activity, primarily done in the industry, and primarily for economic gain. In this talk I will explain why the topic of programming is an important subject of research and scientific enquiry, with several interesting and hard questions such as: How do you write correct programs? How do you debug a large program? What does it take to program the cloud? How do you write programs that compute securely on the cloud? I will present some research projects at Microsoft Research India that aim to address some issues in these questions.
