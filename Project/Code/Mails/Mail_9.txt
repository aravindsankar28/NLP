Abstract of the talk:=20
---------------------=20

A basic assumption in many machine learning algorithms is that the distribu=
tion of the training and test samples are identical. However in many cases,=
 specifically with real world dataset (images, speech, bio metrics, text et=
c.), this assumption is violated. For certain applications, a limited numbe=
r of labeled training samples are available for training a classifier, for =
use with test samples in target domain. However, a large number of labeled =
samples are available with a different distribution from an auxiliary domai=
n, termed as the source domain. Domain adaptation (DA) is a type of transfe=
r learning where one can use the training samples obtained from source doma=
in to aid a statistical learning task to be used on the test samples presen=
t in the target domain, where the distribution of the data in two domains d=
iffer. There are generally two types of domain adaptation techniques availa=
ble in the literature, depending on the training samples available from the=
 target domain: (a) supervised - where we have a sparse set of labeled samp=
les and (b) unsupervised =E2=80=93 with plenty of unlabeled samples.=20



This presentation describes a few methods designed for supervised and unsup=
ervised DA. For supervised DA, we form groups/cluster of data following a G=
aussian distribution. These clusters are individually transformed, such tha=
t the divergence of distribution between that of transformed source domain =
and target domain is minimized. These transformations are formulated using =
the Eigen-values/vectors in one case, and the covariance matrices of both t=
he domains in the other. For unsupervised DA, we minimize the disparity of =
the distribution between the target and transformed source domains, while p=
reserving the spatial arrangement of data in source domain. Two methods of =
optimization (iterative and convex optimization) have been proposed which h=
elp to estimate the transformed source domain data efficiently. A comparati=
ve study of different methods of cross-domain clustering of data, where clu=
sters formed in one domain influence the clusters to be formed in another d=
omain and vice-versa, will be briefly presented. Results on various real-wo=
rld benchmark datasets show the efficiency of our proposed methods.=20
