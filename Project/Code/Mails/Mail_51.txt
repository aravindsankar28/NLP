Sprout : Stochastic Forecasts Achieve High Throughput and Low Delay=20

Abstract:=20
--------=20
Sprout is a transport protocol for interactive applications that=20
desire high throughput and low delay. Sprout does not use TCP-style=20
reactive congestion control; instead the receiver observes the packet=20
arrival times to infer the uncertain dynamics of the network path.=20
This inference is used to forecast how many bytes may be sent by the=20
sender, while bounding the risk that packets will be delayed inside=20
the network for too long. In evaluations on traces from commercial LTE=20
and 3G networks, Sprout achieved 2=E2=80=934 times the throughput of Skype,=
=20
Apple Facetime, and Google Hangout, while reducing self-inflicted=20
delay by 7=E2=80=939 times. Sprout is joint work with Keith Winstein and Ha=
ri=20
Balakrishnan. For more details, please visit: http://alfalfa.mit.edu=20
