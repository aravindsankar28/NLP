Dear all,

I am presenting my first PhD seminar talk on Tuesday, 1st April, 2014 at 3:00 PM. Kindly make it convenient to attend the seminar and give your valuable suggestions.

The details of the talk are as follows.

Title                 :     Applause Identification and its Relevance to Archival of Carnatic music
Date                 :    1st April, 2014
Time                :     3.00 PM
Venue              :     BSB 361, Seminar Hall, Department of Computer ScienceAbstract of the talk:
---------------------Carnatic
 music concert recordings are usually continuous and unsegmented 
recordings. A concert in Carnatic music is around 3 hours long and has 
8-10 items. Carnatic music concerts are generally replete with 
applauses. The audience applauds the artist after the end of every item 
sometimes even within an item. Applauses can be inter-item or intra-item
 applauses. Carnatic music recordings are currently manually segmented 
into items and these items were stored in the database for the purpose 
of archival. My 
research work focusses on detection of applause in a concert and use 
these applause locations as indices to segment the concert into items. 
In fact, identifying these applause locations is very useful for the 
archival of carnatic music concerts, semantic inference, highlights 
extraction etc. To discrminate music and applause, we first study the 
characteristic difference between applause and music using spectral and 
time domain features like spectral flux, spectral entropy, short-time 
energy and zero-crossing rate. Initially, threshold based approach is 
used to distinguish between the music and the applause. Gaussian Mixture
 Models (GMMs) and Support Vector Machines (SVM)  classifiers are used 
to classify music and applause using time and spectral domain features. 
These methods are evaluated on 50 live recordings, music and applause 
classification accuracy using GMM is 98% and using 
SVM is 99%. Further, the CUSUM technique is used to characterize the 
applause locations to find the important audio segments in a concert.ALL ARE WELCOME
