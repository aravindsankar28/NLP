Title : Improving Fairness in Memory Scheduling Using a Team of Learning Automata

Abstract : 


The order in which requests to the main memory are scheduled can have a dramatic impact on fairness, 
performance and power consumption of the memory. With the shift to many-core era, attention has 
shifted from memory schedulers that do not distinguish between different threads, to thread-aware 
memory schedulers. Such conventional schedulers deliver low fairness partly because they do not learn 
from their past decisions. 


We propose an intelligent memory scheduling algorithm for systems with multiple memory controllers. 
Its basic unit is a Finite Action Learning Automaton - a simple model for dynamic decision making in 
unknown environments. The algorithm is decentralized and the controllers implicitly cooperate with 
each other without any exchange of information among them. Our technique on a 16-core simulated 
system gives improvement in fairness for multiprogrammed as well as parallel workloads over Thread 
Cluster Memory Scheduling algorithm. 


Thanks and Regards,
