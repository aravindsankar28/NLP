Abstract of the talk:
---------------------Carnatic music and Hindustani music are two popular mu=
sic traditions in India. In both music traditions, the tonic or key is chos=
en by the performer. All accompanying instruments are tuned to the same ton=
ic. Carnatic music is based on the twelve semitone scales and frequencies o=
f semitones depends on the tonic. The tonic can vary across concerts as wel=
l as musicians. In this work, we propose new features that are extracted fr=
om cent filterbank energies. Cent filterbank energies are obtained by passi=
ng the tonic normalised spectrum through constant Q filters that are placed=
 uniformly on the cent scale. These features are evaluated on different tas=
ks in Carnatic music, namely Carnatic music concert segmentation, motif rec=
ognition, mridangam stroke recognition and other applications. The song ide=
ntification performed on 50 live recordings of Carnatic music using GMMs an=
d Motif recognition performed on 5 different ragas using HMMs. Mridangam st=
roke recognition performed on 10 different strokes using HMMs. Song segment=
ation accuracy is 95%, motif recognition accuracy is 73% and mridangam stro=
ke recognition
accuracy is 77% with cent filter-bank features. The results show that cent =
filter-bank features are indeed important for Carnatic music processing tas=
ks. Cent filterbank based features are compared with the traditional MFCC a=
nd Chroma Filterbank based features. For Carnatic music Cent filterbanks pe=
rform significantly better in comparison with the other features. Finally, =
given the list of items performed in a concert (as meta data), the audio is=
 marked using the text.

ALL ARE WELCOME
