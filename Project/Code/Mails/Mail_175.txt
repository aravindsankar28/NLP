Beyond Worst Case Analysis in Algorithm Design

For many real world computational tasks there is a significant gap between our
theoretical and practical understanding. While the theory of NP-completeness
and worst case analysis tells us that many interesting computational
problems are NP-hard in the worst case, practitioners in areas like machine
learning and computer vision have made significant progress in solving such
theoretically hard problems. Bridging this gap is a significant challenge
for modern day theoretical computer science.

In this talk, I will discuss three paradigms that go beyond traditional
worst-case analysis in our search for algorithms with better provable
guarantees: (realistic) average-case analysis, smoothed analysis and instance
stability. I will use these paradigms to show much better guarantees for
two classes of problems in very different domains:
(a) graph partitioning, and (b) unsupervised learning of probabilistic
models.
