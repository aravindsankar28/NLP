Abstract The Internet consumes about 2% of the total generated power in the world. With increasing 
bandwidth of the networking devices attached to the Internet, power consumed by these 
devices is becoming a major concern. We address the high power consumption problem by 
dividing the Internet into three distinct layers namely: device, network and transport layers. In 
the first seminar we considered methods to reduce power consumption at the network layer. 
We used a metric-based approach to reduce the power consumption of the Internet by finding 
low-power paths through the use of routing protocols. Re-routing could lead to increased delays 
between the end systems. Hence, we proposed an ant-colony based heuristic to balance both 
power and delay in the Internet. 

In this second seminar, we analyze the transport protocol (Transmission Control Protocol - Reno) 
which uses packet-loss as a feedback signal. We choose to study TCP-Reno as it forms the base 
protocol for Cubic and Compound TCP, which are deployed in the Internet. We study local stability 
and the local Hopf bifurcation properties of a fluid model for TCP Reno coupled with queue 
management schemes in routers. We analyze models for the widely deployed Drop-Tail queue policy, 
over a small and an intermediate buffer regime. We also study a model for a threshold based queue 
policy. In small Drop-Tail buffers, stability depends crucially on the buffer size. With intermediate 
buffer Drop-Tail, the system can be locally unstable for large values of the feedback delay and link 
capacities. The threshold based policy highlights the importance of setting queue thresholds guided 
by stability analysis. We show that variations in system parameters can produce Hopf induced limit 
cycles. Using the theory of normal forms and the center manifold theorem, we establish that the Hopf 
bifurcation is supercritical. Packet-level simulations and NetFPGA based experiments for the Drop-Tail 
queue policy corroborate our theoretical analysis. Our work highlights the importance of using a queue 
management schemes that could reduce delay, as well as provide network stability. 

All are welcome
