Dear All,
Please find below a talk announcement.

Speaker: Manish Gupta (Vice President at Xerox Corporation and Director =
of Xerox Research Centre in India).

Title: Deriving Insights from Data: Opportunities for Societal Impact

Time: Friday 2pm.

Location: BSB 361 or BSB 25 (location to be finalized). Another email =
will be sent.

Abstract:

We are entering an era that will usher dramatic changes in most =
industries via exploitation of data. With the availability of abundant =
computing power, proliferation of data from sensors and increasing =
digitization of data that used to be in non-electronic form, there are =
opportunities to enable transformations in the way the world is run. We =
present examples of problems that can be tackled in Healthcare, =
Education, Banking and Transportation domains, each with a potential to =
positively impact the lives of millions of people. We further describe =
unique challenges like scale, heterogeneity and poor infrastructure in =
growth markets like India, which often require new approaches. Diving =
deeper into the healthcare industry, we present preliminary work that =
shows the applicability of remote sensing and data analytics to measure =
body vitals such as respiration and heart rate, and also to diagnose =
diseases such as breast cancer and atrial fibrillation (a form of =
cardiac arrhythmia). As more of the patients=92 medical history gets =
captured in electronic health record systems, there is a further promise =
of applying real-time predictive analytics to assist doctors in =
practicing evidence-based medicine. We present work that significantly =
improves upon the state of the art for a variety of problems, including =
prediction of serious complications such as acute hypotensive episodes =
for patients in an ICU, and predicting the probability of a patient =
requiring ICU admission. Finally, we present some observations on the =
common aspects of these solutions across various industry verticals, =
characterizing these as technology support to enable highly personalized =
services at massive scale and describe some outstanding challenges .
