Abstract: Networks are the simplest form of representation of the interacti=
ons between real world objects. Most of these real world networks exhibit t=
he property of community structure , i.e., nodes in the network can be part=
itioned into communities such that more edges are present between nodes bel=
onging to the same community than between the nodes belonging to different =
community. This structural property has attracted researchers as the commun=
ities in networks correspond to a real world property of the network e.g., =
research area in a collaboration network , related pages in world wide web,=
 etc., Modularity is the widely used scoring function used to measure the q=
uality of these communities. But modularity in itself suffers from resoluti=
on limit, an inability to find communities which are smaller in size when c=
ompared to size of the network. In this work, we identify the necessary fea=
tures that a good scoring function should incorporate in order to character=
ize good community structure and propose a new scoring function which confo=
rms closely with our characterization and which is free from resolution lim=
it. We also do a comparative study of our scoring function with the existin=
g scoring functions and find that our scoring function models the ground-tr=
uth communities better than the existing scoring functions.=20

Louvain method, which greedily maximizes modularity , is the state of the a=
rt algorithm to find communities. We modify Louvain method to greedily maxi=
mize our scoring function. We show that our algorithm gives the expected co=
mmunities in synthetic networks as opposed to Louvain method. We also show =
that the community labels given by our algorithm matches closely with the g=
round-truth community labels in real world networks. Our algorithm is on pa=
r with Louvain method in computation time and hence it can be applied on la=
rge networks also.=20
