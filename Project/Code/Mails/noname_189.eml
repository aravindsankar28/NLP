Preference queries return answers that are relevant to user requirements. A=
 subclass of preference queries, called skyline queries, have been extensiv=
ely studied in the literature for different domains because of their wide a=
pplications in multi-criteria decision making and search space pruning. A s=
kyline query returns all the "interesting" points in a multi-dimensional da=
ta set that are not dominated by any other point with respect to all dimens=
ions. Most of the skyline query processing approaches assume completeness o=
f data, i.e. all dimension values are known for all data points. However, i=
n many real world applications such as location-based services, sensor data=
 and product/service reviews, data points may have missing values on some d=
imensions because of various reasons. Traditional skyline query processing =
algorithms developed for complete data can not be easily adapted for such s=
ituations because of the non-transitive and potentially cyclic nature of do=
minance relation that arises in the case of incomplete data. Unfortunately,=
 skyline query processing for such incomplete data has not received enough =
attention.=20




In the first part of our work, we have proposed an efficient Sort-based Inc=
omplete Data Skyline (SIDS) algorithm to compute the skyline over incomplet=
e data. Extensive experiments on both real world and synthetic data sets de=
monstrate the efficiency, scalability and incremental behavior of our appro=
ach over current state-of-the-art ISkyline algorithm. During later part of =
this work, we have adopted Two Scan Algorithm (TSA), originally proposed fo=
r computing k-dominant skyline (a variant of traditional skyline) and disco=
vered that TSA outperforms both ISkyline and SIDS in terms of execution tim=
e. However, SIDS continues to incur least number of comparisons in majority=
 of the cases.=20




The size of skyline set increases with number of dimensions. Thus, in high-=
dimensional space, skyline points no longer offer any interesting insights.=
 The skyline returned by SIDS also suffers from the same problem. In additi=
on to this, many desirable data points do not belong to the skyline due to =
non-transitive and cylic nature of dominance relation. To find more importa=
nt and meaningful points, various "interestingness" measures have been prop=
osed in literature for complete data. However, no such effort has been made=
 till date for incomplete data. The second part of our work deals with find=
ing superior skyline points from incomplete datasets. We have adopted "freq=
uent skyline" measure proposed for complete data to compare and rank "inter=
estingness" of points. This approach is based on how often they are returne=
d in the skyline when different subspaces are considered. Experimental resu=
lts on NBA dataset shows that we can find superior skyline points even with=
 missing data.=20
