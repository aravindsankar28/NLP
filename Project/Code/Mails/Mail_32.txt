Topic      : Improving Conversational Recommendation based on
Preference-based Feedback
Venue     : BSB 361, Department of Computer Science and Engineering.


Abstract

Conversational recommendation mimics the kind of dialogue that takes place
between a customer and a shopkeeper involving multiple interactions where
the user can give feedback at every interaction. For users who only have a
vague idea of what they want, these systems provide an effective way to
navigate through the product space, educating them on the way. This can be
contrasted with single shot retrieval, where the system retrieves a set of
items in response to a user query in a single interaction. One of the modes
for getting user feedback is preference-based feedback (PBF), where the
user selects one item from a list of products shown to her at each
iteration.
Existing conversational recommender systems based on PBF require experts to
define knowledge containers like similarity measures which involves a lot
of knowledge engineering overhead. We propose a new approach called UtilSim
which reduces the knowledge
engineering overhead and makes use of easy-to-acquire =93domain=94 knowledg=
e to
generate efficient recommendations.
To better approximate the utility of an item for a user, the notion of
compromise was proposed for single shot recommendation settings.
Compromises are defined as the preferences of the user that the recommender
system fails to satisfy. To our knowledge, there has been no work done to
model compromises in a conversational setting, where the user might be
willing to navigate the product space to discover interesting products. We
propose Flexi-Comp, a flexible and dynamic approach to model compromises in
PBF based conversational recommender systems.
Offline evaluation of PBF based conversational recommender systems is
usually done by =93simulating=94 an artificial agent who behaves optimally =
to
reach a predefined target product. To simulate a more realistic setting,
noise is added into the evaluation process by randomly perturbing the
similarities of the recommended products to the target product. Observing
the arbitrariness of noise addition in this way, we argue for a tree based
methodology for introducing noise in a principled manner.


All are welcome!
