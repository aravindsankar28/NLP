Title : Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Video Shots for Content Based Video Ret=
rieval (CBVR)=20
Speaker: Chiranjoy Chattopadhyay (CS10D009)=20
Date : 26 August, 2014 (Tuesday)=20
Time : 4 PM=20
Place : BSB 361, Dept. of CS&E=20


ABSTRACT:=20


Content Based Video Retrieval (CBVR) is the problem of retrieving a set of =
videos from the database (gallery) which are similar to a given query video=
 shot. Some of the application areas of CBVR are, video on-demand, event id=
entification, near-duplicate detection, multimedia content analysis and vid=
eo classification etc. Existing CBVR systems lack in efficiently computing =
a compact, unified (joint) representation of spatio-temporal information. R=
esearch issues involve: efficient tracking in moving camera videos, multipl=
e moving objects, suitable weightage for trajectory and spatio-temporal inf=
ormation, matching criteria etc.=20


This presentation describes a few methods designed to overcome some of the =
key issues related to the CBVR task. Highlights of this talk are the follow=
ing:=20


    =E2=80=A2 Segmenting the prominent moving foreground object in a video =
shot, captured using a moving camera, using iterative refinement over graph=
-cut.=20
    =E2=80=A2 Novel video content descriptors (DMST-CSS, time series repres=
entation) for CBVR task=20
    =E2=80=A2 An approach towards solving the CBVR task for action videos a=
nd complex shots with multiple moving objects, using latent semantic indexi=
ng of spatio-temporal features.=20

Results will be shown using real-world datasets, to exhibit the superiority=
 of the proposed methods.=20


All are welcome.=20
