Abstract: We consider the problem of electing a leader among nodes in a highly dynamic network where adversary has unbounded capacity to insert and remove nodes (including the leader) from the network and change topology at will. We present a randomized algorithm that elects & re-elects a leader in $O(D log n)$ rounds W.H.P. where D is a bound on dynamic diameter of the network and n is a number of nodes in the network in any round. We assume a model of broadcast-based communication where a node can send only one message of $O(log n)$ bits per round per edge and is not aware of recipients in advance(i.e. before the start of the round). Our solution improves the deterministic solution of $O(D.n)$ rounds for termination time, presented at FOMC 2011. We also show that any randomized algorithm solving leader election in our settings, takes $Omega(D. log n)$ rounds to elect a leader which shows that our algorithm yields the most optimal termination time. 
This is joint work with John Augustine, Paresh Nakhe, and Peter Robinson and got accepted in The Ninth ACM International Workshop on Foundation of Mobile Computing (FOMC-2013) , Jerusalem, Israel. Journal version of the same work will be submitted soon. .
