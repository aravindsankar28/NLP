> Dear All,
>
> Dr. Partha Talukdar is a faculty at IISc, SERC. He is a very well known
name in the field of learning on graphs. He will be visiting the CSE
Department on Friday the 21st. He is giving a talk at 11 a.m. in BSB 361.
Details below. All are welcome.
>
> If any one is interested in a one-on-one meeting with him, please let me
know. Partha is here till late in the evening. There will be an interaction
with students organized in the afternoon.
>
> This talk is supported partly by Yahoo! labs.

> Title: Graph-based methods for Web-scale Knowledge Harvesting
> Abstract: Harvesting knowledge from web-scale text datasets has emerged
as an interesting and promising area of research over the last few years,
resulting in the construction of several large knowledge bases (KBs).
Graphs provide a natural way to organize such harvested knowledge.
Moreover, graph-based learning and inference methods have proved to be
effective in the construction of such KBs. In this talk, I shall present an
overview of my research in this area, with examples and applications of
techniques ranging from graph-based semi-supervised learning to random walk
inference over knowledge graphs.

> Partha Pratim Talukdar is an Assistant Professor in the Supercomputer
Education and Research Centre (SERC) at the Indian Institute of Science
(IISc), Bangalore. Before that, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Machine
Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University, working with Tom
Mitchell on the NELL project. Partha received his PhD (2010) in CIS from
the University of Pennsylvania, working under the supervision of Fernando
Pereira, Zack Ives, and Mark Liberman. Partha is broadly interested in
Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Data Integration, and
Cognitive Neuroscience, with particular interest in large-scale learning
and inference over graphs. His past industrial research affiliations
include HP Labs, Google Research, and Microsoft Research. He is a co-author
of the book on Graph-based Semi-Supervised Learning published by Morgan
Claypool Publishers.
