As John Hopfield states in his new book on Analytics, =E2=80=9CFoundations =
of Data Science=E2=80=9D (2013), =E2=80=9C One of the major changes is the =
switch from discrete mathematics to more of an emphasis on probability, sta=
tistics and numerical methods =E2=80=9D. This talk will highlight a new dev=
elopment in stochastic processes created by Erik Vanmarcke called =E2=80=9C=
Random Field Theory=E2=80=9D (RFT) in the 1980s. The speaker links RFT to p=
redicting practical events such as chatter in machine tools and to =E2=80=
=9CX-Events=E2=80=9D as John Casti describes elegantly in his popular scien=
ce book, =E2=80=9CX-Events: The Collapse of Everything=E2=80=9D! The speake=
r will develop the basics of RFT and discuss some second-order properties t=
hat may provide intriguing insights into the behavior of dynamical systems =
as well as possible applications in retail marketing.=20
