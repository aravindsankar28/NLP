Abstract:=20

Degree sequence of a graph is defined as a sequence whose elements are the =
degrees of all the vertices in the graph, and if we form a set correspondin=
g to the given degree sequence we get a degree set. They give an another wa=
y of representing graphs (simple), using O(|V |log|V |) space, but at the c=
ost of loosing their uniqueness. Due to Kapoor et al, we know that any set =
S =3D {a_1 < =C2=B7 =C2=B7 =C2=B7 < a_n}, of positive integers is always re=
alizable by a simple graph with a_n + 1 vertices. Here the interesting ques=
tion is: Can we realize S by a simple graph with exactly r (a_n+1) vertices=
? We have answered this in a positive way. Amazingly if we ask the same que=
stion for tree realizability (a_1 =3D 1) of S, then we found the problem to=
 be NP-Complete. With the same motivation, we extended the degree set defin=
ition to digraphs(simple) under different realizibility notions, and showed=
 that any set, S =3D {a_1 < =C2=B7 =C2=B7 =C2=B7 < a_n}, of positive intege=
rs can always be realized by an asymmetric graph with exactly r vertices. E=
ven for directed trees, such extensions are always possible. We will also d=
iscuss about multiplicity-constrained degree sets, an intermediate case bet=
ween degree sets and degree sequences, where we restrict the number of time=
s that a vertex in the degree set appears in the realization. In this direc=
tion, we particularly focus on the tree-realizability of degree sets under =
multiplicity constraints on each degree.=20
