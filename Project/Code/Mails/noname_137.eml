Dear All,
Here is a double treat. Two back-to-back talks in the areas on GPGPU and =
APU related areas. All are welcome to attend. If you are interested to =
meet the speakers then drop me a note. I will fix a slot. They will be =
here on 6th September, the whole day.

Talk 1: "Atomics and Memory Consistency on Accelerated Processing Units =
(APUs)".

C11/C1x atomics is a new addition to the C++ standard aimed at =
concurrent programming. This consists of support for atomic types and =
operations on such types. This helps programmers reason about concurrent =
programs in a neater way. The atomics operations also provide a =
mechanism to support memory consistency across multiple threads via =
memory ordering provided by the programmer. In this talk we will =
introduce concepts of memory consistency and discuss atomic operations =
which use these. We will dwell on the compiler implications of these as =
well as what kind of code needs to be generated by the compiler. We will =
touch upon supporting atomics for heterogeneous systems like accelerated =
processing units (APUs). If time permits, we will look at a case of =
lock-free data structure using atomics.


Speaker Brief Bio: Dr. Dibyendu Das is a Fellow at AMD India where he =
works on compilers for heterogeneous architectures. In previous lives he =
had worked for Motorola, HP and IBM, mainly in the area of optimizing =
compilers. Dibyendu has a PhD from IIT Kharagpur.


Talk 2:=20
Title: "Heterogeneous Computing at AMD"
Abstract: Heterogeneous computing is new generation computing where =
developer can seamlessly target various kinds of compute elements or =
accelerators. First part of the talk would be focused on what is =
heterogeneous computing and why is challenging for developers. In the =
second part, we will see how AMD has tried to address this challenge for =
their APUs with HSA stack. We will see one case study of JAVA APARAPI.

Brief bio: Dr. Prakash Raghavendra completed his PhD (IISc) in 1998 in =
the area of Parallelizing Compilers. He worked at HP, Bangalore from =
1998-2007 in the area of compiler/java. He had a brief stint at Adobe =
systems where he worked in the area of Flex compilers. He was then =
faculty (Assoc Prof) at NITK Surathkal from 2009-12. Currently he works =
as PMTS in the HSA compiler team at AMD, Bangalore.
