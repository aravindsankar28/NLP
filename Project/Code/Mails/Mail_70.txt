Title: Searching and Bargaining with Middlemen 

Speaker: Dr. Vijay G Subramanian 
Northwestern University 


Room: ESB244 

Time: Aug 2 (Friday), 3 p. m. 

Abstract: We study decentralized markets which include middlemen, producers and consumers 
connected via a trading network. We develop a model for trade in such settings based on 
non-cooperative bargaining with search frictions. Our goal is to investigate how the structure of 
the trading network and the role of middlemen influence the market's efficiency and fairness. To 
this end, we introduce the concept of limit stationary equilibrium which characterizes the trading 
patterns that emerge in a general trading network with a large population of agents. We use this 
concept to analyze how competition among middlemen is influenced by the network structure, how 
endogenous delay emerges in trade and how surplus is shared between producers and 
consumers. This is joint work with Thanh Nguyen and Randy Berry at Northwestern University. 

Bio: Vijay G. Subramanian is a Research Assistant Faculty in the EECS Department at 
Northwestern University. He obtained his Ph. D. from UIUC in 1999. After graduating he worked 
in the research arm of Motorola, and thereafter at the Hamilton Institute in Ireland. His current 
research interests are on game theoretic and economic modeling of socio-technological systems 
and networks, social networks and the analysis of associated stochastic processes. Other research interests are in stochastic modeling, communications, information theory and applied mathematics with a large portion of past work on probabilistic analysis of communication networks, especially analysis of scheduling and routing algorithms. In the past he has also done some work with applications in immunology and coding of stochastic processes.
