This Friday, 12th July, Prof. Niloy Ganguly from IIT Kharagpur will be deli=
vering a talk on citation network analysis. The talk is at 2 p.m. in CSE Se=

Title: Shift of research focus in Computer Sciences over the last fifty yea=
rs: What citation network analysis reflects?=20





Abstract: Study of community in time-varying graphs has been limited to its=
 detection and identification across time. How ever, presence of time provi=
des us with the opportunity to analyze the interaction patterns of the comm=
unities, understand how each individual community grows/shrinks, becomes im=
portant over time. This paper, for the first time, systematically studies t=
he temporal interaction patterns of communities using a large scale citatio=
n network (directed and unweighted) of computer science. Each individual co=
mmunity in a citation network is naturally defined by a research field =E2=
=80=93 i.e., acting as ground-truth =E2=80=93 and their interactions throug=
h citations in real time can unfold the landscape of dynamic research trend=
s in the computer science domain over the last fifty years. These interacti=
ons are quantified in terms of a metric called inwardness that captures the=
 effect of local citations to express the degree of authoritativeness of a =
community (research field) at a particular time instance. Several arguments=
 to unveil the reasons behind the temporal changes of inwardness of differe=
nt communities are put forward using exhaustive statistical analysis. The m=
easurements (importance of field) are compared with the project funding sta=
tistics of NSF and it is found that the two are in sync. We believe that th=
is measurement study with a large real-world data is an important initial s=
tep towards understanding the dynamics of cluster-interactions in a tempora=
l environment. This work , for the first time, systematically outlines a ne=
w avenue of research that one can practice post community detection. As an =
additional objective we also study the emergence of the rising popularity o=
f interdisciplinary research in the computer sciences.=20
