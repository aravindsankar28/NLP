Sir,

I apologize for absence of time change information in schedule. We anno=
unced about the change of timing multiple times from help desk. May be =
because people were involved in many events, the announcement might not=
 have reached some people.

I personally want to appreciate your talk. Your talk has been one of th=
e best talk in exebit. People from other colleges even praised your tal=
k a lot and recalled your talks in NIT, tirchy etc. It was presented ve=
ry well and I'm sure not even a single participant would have missed a =
single word of you.

Thank you for the awesome talk and adding charm to exebit.

Regards,
Sai Nageswar Satchidanand

Dear All,=20
this is not a crib or flame mail but I wish to point out that my talk w=
as handled very poorly by the organizers . the change in time was not m=
entioned or not informed properly=20
and many who wanted to attend missed the talk.=20
I am aware i am no VIP but if you invite someone, then, a due respect s=
hould be given. I normally do not accept invitations in such events bec=
ause technical talks by academics, that too by locals, will be least re=
spected. Still, i thought i should give a try and did it and , as expec=
ted, participation even in a lesser event is more. it is not the number=
 in the audience that bothered me but the general apathy of organizers =
on my talk did hurt me . Hope other technical talks went off well.=20


Again, i want to clarify that this is not a flame mail. this is to poin=
t out a weak link in the organization of event. hope this feedback will=
 help organizers of subsequent exhibits=20
plan and coordinate the events better. no wonder nobody even mentions o=
n the talk in any newsletter or other stuffs.. not even an acknowledgem=
ent!!!! In fact, I cut short a trip to accommodate the request of the s=
tudents and readily agreed but it is clear that return of respect or ho=
nour was definitely missing..=20


cordially,=20
