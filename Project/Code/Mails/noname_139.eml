Title: Probabilistic Programming: A Program Analysis Perspective

Abstract:****

Probabilistic models, particularly those with causal dependencies, can be
succinctly written as probabilistic programs. Recent years have seen a
proliferation of languages for writing such probabilistic programs, as well
as tools and techniques for performing inference over these programs In
this talk, we show that static and dynamic program analysis techniques can
be used to infer quantities of interest to the machine learning community,
thereby providing a new and interesting domain of application for program
analysis. In particular, we show that static analysis techniques inspired
by dataflow analysis and iterative refinement techniques can be used for
Bayesian inference. We also show that dynamic analysis techniques inspired
by directed testing and symbolic execution can be used for sampling
probabilistic programs.****
