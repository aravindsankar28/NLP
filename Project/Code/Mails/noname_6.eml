Dear Scholars and Students,
As you know we have a new course CS7030 (Recent Topics in Compilers) =
that is being offered in Jan 2015. It will be a paper reading course -- =
where we will be reading about some of the latest and coolest papers in =
the broad area of compilers. For background, we will  read a few  =
classical papers as well. The course will not have any midterm/final, =
and the evaluation will be based on weekly presentations (along with a =
possibly small writeup) and a final research proposal (along with a =
solution).

If you have questions regarding this course, you are welcome to talk to =
Rupesh or me.

Warm regards,
Krishna and Rupesh.=
