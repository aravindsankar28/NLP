Title: Building Online Services at scale

Abstract: The talk will outline some key learnings from building online ser=
vices at scale. A lot of these learnings would seem like common sense, but =
over multiple teams it is clear that it is not obvious enough to make sense=
 as teams getting into the online services space for the first time repeat =
many of these mistakes. The talk usually illustrates the key points with re=
al world examples, but for confidentiality the learnings will be illustrate=
d through fictitious examples.
