Abstract:=20

Many decades after quantum mechanics was accepted as a more accurate model =
of the physical world, Richard Feynman proposed the brilliant vision of bui=
lding computers based on quantum mechanical systems in 1981. The two major =
drivers for the development in this =EF=AC=81eld are the need to overcome t=
he limitations both in the theory of computing with classical deterministic=
 digital computing models and in the technology of building them. With a br=
ief introduction to the motivation for quantum computing, we will discuss t=
he basic model and the operations. Notwithstanding the limitations in physi=
cal realizations, there has been progress in the technology of quantum comp=
uters during the last quarter of a century. The main focus of this talk is =
on reliable synthesis methods for quantum computers starting with a set of =
fundamental quantum gates realizable in the existing technologies.=20
