Abstract:=20

Consecutive Ones Property (COP) is a well studied combinatorial property of=
 binary matrices. A binary matrix has the COP, if there exists a permutatio=
n of columns that arranges the ones consecutively in all the rows. In the f=
irst part of the talk, we will focus on testing the COP of a binary matrix.=
 We will see that this problem is equivalent to finding a feasible interval=
 assignment to the set system associated with the binary matrix. We then pr=
esent the intersection cardinality preserving interval assignment ( ICPIA )=
 characterization of matrices with the COP. Also, we describe the details o=
f finding a feasible interval assignment to the set sys tem , if one exists=
. In the second part, we pose an optimization problem (Min- ICPIA ) related=
 to the ICPIA characterization and show that this problem is equivalent to =
the classical Vertex Cover problem. Finally, we consider the Consecutive On=
es Submatrix (COS) problem to deal with matrices that do not have the COP. =
Given a binary matrix M and a positive integer d, COS by row deletion is to=
 decide whether there exists a set of at most d-rows of M whose deletion re=
sults in a matrix with the COP. We show that COS problem is fixed-parameter=
 tractable ( FPT ) with d as the parameter. We establish this via the FPT a=
lgorithm for Interval Deletion problem.=20
