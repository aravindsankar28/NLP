Talk: Covert Timing Channels in Cryptography - the Case of Time-Driven Cach=
e Attacks on Block Ciphers=20




Most implementations of cryptographic algorithms leak sensitive information=
 through side-channels such as power, timing, and electro-magnetic radiatio=
n of the device thus leading to the compromise of the system. The analysis =
of side-channel attacks is difficult because the leakage not only depends o=
n the cipher algorithm but also on the implementation and the execution pla=
tform. As a result most prevention techniques are ad-hoc, bulky, and not ve=
ry effective. This talk focuses on a category of side-channel attacks known=
 as time-driven cache attacks, which retrieves sensitive information by uti=
lizing variations in the execution time of a block cipher. The talk shows h=
ow the magnitude of information leakage is affected by the interplay of the=
 cache architecture, the block cipher algorithm, and its implementation. Fu=
rthermore, for a given block cipher algorithm and cache architecture, infor=
mation leakage can be eliminated by carefully tuning the implementation. Th=
e talk demonstrates how such ideal implementations can be mathematically de=
rived thus providing a systematic approach to implementing block ciphers se=
cure against time-driven cache attacks.=20
