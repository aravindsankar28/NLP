Abstract : In the last two decades, there has been tremendous interest in d=
efining and studying new computing paradigms=20
which are inspired by nature. Natural computing has emerged as an area whic=
h is followed with a lot of interest.=20
P systems introduced by Gh. P\u{a}un, are computing models inspired from th=
e structure and functioning of the=20
living cells. A P system consists of a finite number of membranes, each of =
which contains a multiset of objects=20
from a finite alphabet. The membranes are organized as a Venn diagram or a =
tree structure where membranes may=20
contain other membranes. The dynamics of the system is governed by a set of=
 rules associated with each membrane.=20
Each rule specifies how objects evolve and move into neighboring membranes.=
 It has been introduced as a computing=20
model which abstracts from the way live cells process chemical compounds in=
 their =E2=80=9Ccompartmental=E2=80=9D (membrane) structure.=20
Various models of P systems have been shown to be equivalent to Turing mach=
ines in computing power.=20

We consider a way of controlling the computation of a P system. A label is =
assigned to every rule, where the labels are=20
chosen from a finite alphabet. P systems with label restricted transitions =
are considered (in each step, all rules used have=20
either the same label, or, possibly, the empty label, $\lambda$), then P sy=
stems with the computations controlled by languages=20
(as in context-free controlled grammars). The relationships between the fam=
ilies of sets of numbers computed by the various=20
classes of controlled P systems are investigated, also comparing them with =
length sets of languages in Chomsky hierarchies=20
(characterizations of the length sets of recursively enumerable languages a=
re obtained in this framework).=20
