Abstract: 

Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) plays a prominent role in many areas like information retrieval, Computer vision and signal processing. In many real time applications, obsolete data needs to be removed when fresh data arrives. If the matrices used in modeling the systems are large, computation of SVD from scratch is not feasible and there exists a need for incremental methods to compute the SVD of the modified matrix. Computing SVD of a matrix after removing/adding some rows or columns from the matrix using the current SVD is known as SVD downdate/update problem. 


The first part of the talk focuses on a new algorithm for the SVD downdate problem. The algorithm uses a k-rank approximation of an m x n system and the downdate operations are done on the decomposed form directly, saving both space and time. Also, the algorithm inspects the entries in the matrices only a constant number of times making it a streaming algorithm. However, this algorithm is not error-free. 


In the second part of the talk, I will talk about a new error-free streaming algorithm for the SVD downdate problem. We developed a QR-like decomposition technique that is fast and efficient (both in time and in space). We show how to build an error-free SVD downdate algorithm using the QR-like decomposition. 


Finally, we touch upon an error-free streaming algorithm for the SVD update problem. We also show how our techniques for downdate and update can be combined to perform simultaneous downdate and update. Such an operation finds application in video processing. 


All are welcome!
