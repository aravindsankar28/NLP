It is a gent le reminder to inform that today I will be giving my second PhD seminar. All are welcome. 



Trees Spanners and Cycle Bases 
(On Nov 12th , at 4 PM , in CS 34 by G.Ramakrishna) 



This talk begins with an introduction to the following three problems, followed by a quick survey of the existing results. 


Tree spanner problem. Give an unweigted graph G and a positive integer t, find a spanning tree T of G with the property that, for every edge (u, v) in G, there is a path of length at most t between u and v in T (if exists). 


Minimum total-stretch spanning tree problem. Given an unweighted graph G, find a spanning tree T that minimizes the sum of the distances between u and v in T over all the edges (u, v) in G. 


Minimum cycle basis problem. Given a weighted graph G, find a minimal set B of cycles, such that every cycle in G can be generated by performing ex-or sum on a set of cycles from B and the sum-total weight over all the cycles in B is minimum. 


We then present our linear-time algorithms for tree t-spanner problem in outerplanar graphs and minimum cycle basis problem in weighted partial 2-trees. Further, we present an algorithm for minimum total stretch spanning tree problem that runs in O(n log n) time. Finally, we look at the connections across these problems. 

Thanks,
