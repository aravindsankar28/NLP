Experimental Study on IPv6 Data Plane Flows for Reflector Attack Characteri=
zation and Mitigation=20

The commonly prevalent flood based DDoS attacks with the magnitude of 10 Gb=
ps indicate the necessity for routine mitigation of these attacks a day-to-=
day activity to the Internet Service Providers (ISPs). Main targets of DDoS=
 attacks are ancillary Data center services such as Web portals, shared Web=
 hosts, DNS servers and SMTP. The attackers make use of multivector DDoS at=
tacks and complex application layer methodologies to achieve their goals. R=
eflector attack is one such attack accomplished by making use of protocol r=
equirements in transport and application layers. It drains huge volumes of =
bandwidth that ISPs purchase from the transit and peer providers. The 2011 =
Arbor Network security report observes DNS reflection/amplification attack =
to the magnitude of 60 Gbps with an yearly rise of 40%. The important compo=
nents of Data centers such as load balancers, firewalls and Intrusion preve=
ntion system fail due to these attacks. Data center targeted attacks lead t=
o customer churn and related revenue loss to the ISPs. The increase in depl=
oyment of IPv6 in the wake of IPv4 address space exhaustion lead to inserti=
on of large number of network elements like 6to4 gateways and Carrier Grade=
 Network address translators in the backbone. In addition to reflection/amp=
lification flow dynamics, the inclusion of stateful elements like 6to4 gate=
ways and less visibility of IPv6 based attacks to the firewalls pose additi=
onal challenge for framing rules to mitigation techniques. In our work, we =
have carried out an experimental study on IPv6 reflector attacks using a re=
al time testbed. The testbed consists of 2 Mbps MPLS mesh backbone intercon=
necting 8 IPv6 LANs with 6to4 gateways deployed on edge routers. The attack=
er and victim edge router flow characterization considering various factors=
 and rules identified for mitigation techniques are the contributions of th=
e work. The IPv6 reflector attack flow rate that chokes the victim using re=
flection/amplification for single and multiple flows are analyzed to differ=
ent flow rates. The effectiveness of the identified anomaly based rules to =
edge routers is measured in terms of false positives and false negatives ra=
tes. We have used IPv6 ftp application traffic to represent the normal traf=
fic during the measurement period. The optimal flow sampling interval is ob=
tained for 5 % false positive and 7 % false negative rates to different att=
ack flow frequency and flow duration.=20
