Dear all,

Dr. Sayan Bhattacharya, currently a postdoc at MPI, Saarbruecken, Germany, =
will be visiting our department next week. He will be presenting his work o=
n Tuesday, Nov 5th, from 3 - 4PM in BSB 361. Kindly mark your calendars and=
 make yourself available. The title and abstract are given below.

Regards,
John.

Price of Anarchy, Auctions, and Approximations.
Sayan Bhattacharya.

In many applications driven by the internet, computation needs to be perfor=
med in the presence of=C2=A0 strategic interactions between multiple=C2=A0 =
autonomous entities. This raises the question: What happens when the input =
to an algorithm are controlled by rational agents, and each of them has a s=
take in the algorithm's output? A systematic study of this question led to =
the inception and growth of ``algorithmic game theory''. In the talk I will=
 focus on two important topics within this field -- the study of auctions, =
and price of anarchy.

Motivated by the electronic markets such as eBay and Google adwords, I will=
 first visit the topic of Auction Theory from an algorithmic perspective.=
=C2=A0 In this setting, an auctioneer wants to sell some items to a group o=
f bidders. The bidders' valuations for the items are private knowledge, but=
 they are drawn from publicly known prior distributions. An auction scheme =
is called ``truthful'' if it gives an incentive to every bidder to report h=
er true=C2=A0 value. The goal is to find a truthful auction that maximizes =
the seller's revenue.

Naturally, to execute the optimal auction we need to know the prior distrib=
utions. An intriguing question is to design a truthful auction that does no=
t require the knowledge of these priors, but still manages to get a constan=
t fraction of the optimal revenue. Such auctions are called {\em prior-free=
}. I will conclude the first part of the talk by presenting my recent work =
on prior-free auctions with asymmetric bidders.

Next, I will consider the game-theoretic variant of a classical scheduling-=
problem. The setting captures a distributed environment with heterogeneous =
machines (or data centers) and jobs (or clients) that are situated across d=
ifferent geographical locations.=C2=A0 The objective is to=C2=A0 minimize t=
he weighted sum of the completion times of the jobs. Each job, however, is =
a selfish agent and selects a machine that=C2=A0 minimizes=C2=A0 its own co=
mpletion time. This defines a game between the jobs.=C2=A0 A Nash equilibri=
um of this game is an outcome where no job wants to switch to another machi=
ne. The ``price of anarchy'' is now defined as the maximum possible ratio b=
etween the objective at a Nash equilibrium and the objective at the globall=
y-optimal outcome.

I will present a generic characterization of the scheduling policies which =
give a small Price of Anarchy. On the technical side, I will show how to de=
rive this result using a=C2=A0 linear program for the underlying optimizati=
on problem and dual-fitting.

I will conclude the talk by presenting some interesting open directions for=
 future research.
