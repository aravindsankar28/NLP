As John Hopfield states in his new book on
Analytics, =E2=80=9CFoundations of Data Science=E2=80=9D (2013), =E2=80=9CO=
ne of the
major changes is the switch from discrete mathematics to more of an
emphasis on probability, statistics and numerical methods=E2=80=9D.
This talk will highlight a new development in stochastic processes
created by Erik Vanmarcke called =E2=80=9CRandom Field Theory=E2=80=9D (RFT=
) in
the 1980s. The speaker links RFT to predicting practical events such
as chatter in machine tools and to =E2=80=9CX-Events=E2=80=9D as John Casti
describes elegantly in his popular science book, =E2=80=9CX-Events: The
Collapse of Everything=E2=80=9D! The speaker will develop the basics of RFT
and discuss some second-order properties that may provide intriguing
insights into the behavior of dynamical systems as well as possible
applications in retail marketing.PG Madhavan Bio:Dr. P.G. Madhavan =E2=80=
