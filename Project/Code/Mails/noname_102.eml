Dear Scholars 

Greetings and Gentle reminder for the talk that is happening today. This will be last task as part of Research Scholar Forum for this semester. 

Kindly make it convenient to attend and share your feedback to Anik. He would be making this presentation at ICON 2013 at Singapore shortly. 

Kind regards 
Mani

Dear Scholars 


Greetings 

Coming Monday - Nov 25th 2013, will be the last presentation as part of Research Scholar Forum talk for this Semester. 

The presenter is Anik Sen Gupta (HPCN Lab). Anik's publication has been accepted at ICON 2013 (19th IEEE International conference on Networks, taking place at Singapore). 
As part of the Research Scholar's Forum presentation, Anik will be presenting his publication. 

Title of his talk is "An Efficient Preamble Compression for Multi Clock-rate Sampling Wireless Devices" 

Abstract: The recent trend in wireless communication networks has seen the focus shift from spectrum efficiency to energy efficiency. 
Use of multi clock-rate sampling devices to provide reduced power idle listening promises to significantly reduce power consumption 
in wireless devices without affecting throughput or transmission range. However, the use of frequency agnostic preamble to enable 
multi clock-rate detection causes linear scaling of preamble length, and consequently, the goodput performance of the network suffers. 
We look at a modification of RObust Header Compression (ROHC) as a means to restrict header length scaling and its applicability in 
networks of multi-frequency sampling wireless devices. We analyze the modified preamble compression scheme deployed on multi 
clock-rate sampling wireless devices and determine performance metrics such as channel utilization and goodput across different error 
rates and downclocking factors. The energy efficiency performance of such a network is also studied. The results obtained are validated using extensive simulation. 

Kindly attend Anik's presentation and share your valuable feedback to make his presentation successful at ICON 2013. 

Since this is the last meeting for this semester, Snacks will be served at the end of the presentation. 

Kind regards 
Mani
