Dear All, 
 
A gentle reminder: we have Dr. Sriram's talk at 4 PM today at BSB 361.

Best Regards,
Sutanu.

> 
> System health management deals with supporting the operation of a
> system in the presence of faults in one or more components (hardware
> and software) of the system being monitored. Tasks involved include
> diagnosis (fault detection, isolation and identification), prognosis
> (fault impact analysis, end of life prediction), decision making
> (fault mitigation and recovery). The end goal is to maximize the
> achievement of original system objectives while maintaining the
> requirements of safety and cost. Model-based diagnosis techniques use
> structural, behavioral and/or functional models of the system to
> detect and isolate faults. Given the wide variety of faults
> (component/sensor, discrete/continuous, persistent/intermittent etc.)
> that occur in real systems and the presence of uncertainties (sensor
> noise, unknown environment etc.) no single technique can handle all
> situations effectively and efficiently. In this talk I will present 2
> model-based diagnosis techniques (FACT and HyDE) that deal with
> entirely different situations. FACT uses a formal modeling framework
> and diagnoses single parametric faults (abrupt change in parameter
> value) while HyDE uses a more general modeling framework to diagnosis
> multiple discrete faults (abrupt change in state of component). These
> 2 approaches are just a couple of drops in the large ocean of
> techniques proposed by researchers in the model-based and other
> (data-driven for example) communities. I will also present work I was
> involved in that attempted to develop a standard set of metrics to
> evaluate and compare various diagnosis methodologies. This work also
> resulted in the development of a framework to execute diagnostic
> applications on a common platform which led to a series of
> international diagnostic competitions. Finally I will present some
> applications at NASA that are using/have used model-based reasoning
> applications.
