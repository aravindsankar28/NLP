Dear All,=20


I am giving my second Ph.D seminar on 24 th June 2013 ( Monday ) from 1.30p=
m to 2.30pm at BSB 361. Please make it convenient to attend and give your v=
aluable suggestions.=20

Provable Security is an approach to provide evidence of security by means o=
f reduction. If the cryptosystem can be broken in some specific way, then i=
t would be possible to efficiently solve some well-studied problem that is =
thought to be difficult. The problems normally used are factoring problem, =
discrete logarithm problem, computational Diffie-Hellman problem and so on.=
 When quantum computer comes into existence the aforementioned problems can=
 be solved. So the research goes on searching the problems that cannot be s=
olved by quantum computer. The areas found out so far are Lattice based, Co=
de based, Hash based and Multivariate based cryptosystems. The cryptography=
 based on the said areas is termed as Post quantum cryptography.=20
In cryptography, an oblivious transfer protocol (OT) is a type of protocol =
in which a sender transfers one of potentially many pieces of information t=
o a receiver, but remains oblivious as to what piece (if any) has been tran=
sferred. Since OT is one of the well established cryptographic primitives t=
hat has played a prominent role in achieving secure two-(multi-)party/distr=
ibuted computation. Some of the applications of OT includes Private Informa=
tion Retrieval (PIR), fair electronic contract signing, zero knowledge proo=
fs, secure function evaluation aids in developing a one-time proxy signatur=
e. In a 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer protocol, the sender has two messages=
 m0 and m1 , and the receiver has a bit b, and the receiver wishes to recei=
ve mb , without the sender learning b, while the sender wants to ensure tha=
t the receiver receives only one of the two messages. A 1-out-of-n obliviou=
s transfer protocol can be defined as a natural generalization of a 1-out-o=
f-2 oblivious transfer protocol. Instead of two there are n messages, and t=
he receiver has an index i, of his wish to get the i -th among the sender=
=E2=80=99s messages, such that the sender will not learn i, but sender ensu=
res that the receiver receive only one of the n messages.=20
