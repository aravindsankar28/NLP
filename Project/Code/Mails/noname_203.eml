About the Talk:=20

Case based reasoning (CBR) attempts to solve a given problem by referring t=
o similar problems encountered in the past and using their solutions to arr=
ive at a solution for the new problem. Past experiences, referred to as cas=
es, are typically stored in a case base as problem-solution pairs. So, the =
primary assumption behind all CBR systems is that =E2=80=9Csimilar problems=
 have similar solutions=E2=80=9D and the measure which calculates the degre=
e to which this similarity assumption holds good is called =E2=80=98alignme=
nt=E2=80=99. However, this traditional view of CBR may be a=EF=AC=80ected i=
n some regions of the case base due to the presence of noisy cases, an irre=
levant set of attributes or an inappropriate similarity measure. The qualit=
y of the cases maintained in a case base has a direct in=EF=AC=82uence on t=
he quality of the proposed solutions. The presence of cases that do not con=
form to the similarity hypothesis decreases the alignment of the case base =
and often degrades the performance of a CBR system. It is therefore importa=
nt to =EF=AC=81nd out the suitability of each case for the application of C=
BR and associate a solution with a certain degree of con=EF=AC=81dence. Fea=
ture weighting also determines the success of a system, as the presence of =
irrelevant and redundant attributes results in incorrect solutions. We addr=
ess the above problems with reference to a real-world CBR application calle=
d InfoChrom. It is used to predict the values of several soil nutrients bas=
ed on features extracted from a chromatogram image of a soil sample. We pro=
pose novel feature weighting techniques based on alignment, as well as a ne=
w alignment and con=EF=AC=81dence measure as potential solutions to these p=
roblems. The hypotheses are evaluated on UCI datasets and the case base of =
Infochrom and show promising results. We also present ways of learning case=
-case similarities which is often a non-trivial task and involves signi=EF=
=AC=81cant amount of domain expertise. Our approach to learning similaritie=
s involves learning an appropriate set of feature weights while the domain =
expert iteratively interacts with a case base visualizer called iCaseViz de=
veloped for the above purpose. We provide results on the e=EF=AC=83ciency o=
f the visualizer and the e=EF=AC=80ectiveness of our similarity learning al=
gorithm on UCI datasets and the case base of InfoChrom.=20
