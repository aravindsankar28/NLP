
Dear All, 


A gentle reminder for my first PhD seminar. 


Title : Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Video Shots for Content Based Video Retrieval (CBVR) Task

ABSTRACT: 

The task of Content Based Video Retrieval (CBVR) is far from mature and is influenced by a high degree of subjectivity. The overall objective of the work is to give a "compact representation of video content and retrieve similar video shots'' from a database. This requires efficient organization of video database for fast search and a robust representation of video shots for accurate retrieval of video based on its content. 

In this talk, I will be presenting some novel and efficient techniques (e.g. hyperstring and EMST-CSS) proposed by us for video content representation, by combining spatial and temporal features. Results will be shown using a few benchmark real-world datasets. 

Regards,
