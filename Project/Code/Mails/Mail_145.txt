Abstract: 
We developed novel analytical models for nano-scale CMOS technologies that yield accurate estimations of delay and power for multi-Vt designs in the presence of process-strength variations and temperature. These models are then applied to a post-layout ARM processor block implemented using mixed-Vt cells (SVT and LVT) running at 1.25Ghz with 28nm technology, and shown to have less than 3% RMS Error when compared with those, reported using detailed timing and power analysis tool. 
With the use of these models along with a standard optimizer, it is shown that the optimized supply and body-bias voltage assignment for the same design provides up to 40% (30%) run-time power reduction in the presence (absence) of on-chip temperature sensors when compared with ASV (a static process-strength aware adaptive supply voltage) conditions. A thermal-sensor feedback based dynamic supply and body-bias voltage assignment scheme is also applied to 3D CMPs and shown to have significant power reduction and peak temperature reduction. 

All are welcome!
