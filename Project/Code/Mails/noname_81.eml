Subject: Talk by Julian Dolby at 10am tomorrow in CS36 



(pl. note he is giving best paper at PLDI talk at ISEC 2014 this week at IIT Madras) 
title: Analysis of JavaScript Programs 

abstract: 

As dynamic Web applications written in JavaScript become ever more common, there is a growing need for program analysis of this JavaScript code. Applications of this analysis include security analyses and also the kinds of rich IDE environments that programmers have come to expect for other languages. However, traditional program analysis of JavaScript program has proven extremely challenging, due to the dynamic nature of the language and pervasive use of some hard-to-analyze idioms. In this talk, I will discuss the analysis challenges posed by JavaScript and our attempts to meet them. I shall present work from multiple papers, covering both traditional program analysis and newer work on approximate analysis. 














Julian Dolby has been a Research Staff Member at IBM's Thomas 
J. Watson Research Center since 2000. He works on a range of topics, 
including static program analysis, software testing, concurrent 
programming models and the semantic Web. His program analysis work 
has recently focused on scripting languages like JavaScript and on 
security analysis of Web applications; this work has been included in 
IBM products, most notably Rational AppScan, Standard Edition and 
Source Edition, and he is one of the primary authors of the 
publicly-available Watson Libraries for Analysis (WALA) program 
analysis infrastructure. He was educated at the University of 
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as a graduate student where he worked 
with Professor Andrew Chien on programming systems for 
massively-parallel machines.
