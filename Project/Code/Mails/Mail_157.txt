Abstract: 

The minimum-cost flow problem is a classic combinatorial optimization problem. Several pseudo-polynomial, polynomial, and strongly polynomial algorithms have been developed in the past decades, and it seems that both problem and algorithms are well understood. However, some of the algorithms' running-times observed in empirical studies contradict the running-times obtained by worst-case analysis not only in the order of magnitude but also in the ranking when compared to each other. For instance, the successive shortest path algorithm (SSP) - exponential in the worst case - seems to outperform the strongly polynomial minimum-mean cycle canceling algorithm. 

To explain the discrepancy, we study SSP in the framework of smoothed analysis. We establish a bound of O(nm phi (m + n log n)) for its smoothed running-time, where phi is the perturbation parameter. This shows that worst-case instances for SSP are not robust and unlikely to be encountered in practice. As a by-product, we obtain a randomized simplex method with shadow-vertex pivot rule that achieves polynomial expected running-time on the flow polytope.
