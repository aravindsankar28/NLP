Hi,

I was wondering whether we could have a system similar to that of IIT
> Bombay, where the webpage at www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~studentname<http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/%7Estudentname>is moved to
> www.cse.iitm.ac.in/alumni/~studentname<http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/alumni/%7Estudentname>on graduation.
>
After a brief discussion in the afternoon, following issue came up.

Right now, the usernames etc get purged when we graduate, this makes it
possible for incoming students to get simpler usernames. (After I graduate,
another Sujeet can have sujeet as his username).

Keeping the above in mind, we could either have alumni pages in the form:

   1. www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~cs09b010
   2. www.cse.iitm.ac.in/alumni/2013/~sujeet

Ravi sir was wondering which one would the students prefer (he thought the
first one would be preferred, while I thought that most of us would prefer
the second one)

Thanks and regards,
