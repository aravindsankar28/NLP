TITLE:=20
Load Dependent Network Function Placement based=C2=A0
Passive Optical Network Architectures=20

ABSTRACT:=20

Existing passive optical network (PON) architectures consist of an
optical line terminal (OLT) at the provider side connecting multiple
optical network units (ONUs) at the subscriber side. These ONUs are
connected to end-user equipment at the customer premises. Even though,
optical access networks are more power efficient when compared to
other access network technologies such as DSL, the network still
consumes significant amount of power at off-peak network loads. To
address this gap, new power-efficient architectures have been
developed as part of this work. A formal language notation to
represent PON architecture was developed; Mealy's machine from finite
automata was used to solve the problem.  Additional constraints such
as power budget constraints were mapped on to state transitions of the
machine. Novel PON architectures that are power-efficient even during
off-peak network loads were derived using this machine.  These
architectures were numerically evaluated for different network
loads. Packet delay and throughput were measured for a subset of these
architectures using discrete event simulation models.  Two of the
proposed architectures are shown to help achieve at least 35% power
savings over existing systems. There is no significant deviation
observed in terms of network performance during off-peak
network loads.
