Abstract:=20

Consecutive Ones Property (COP) is a well studied combinatorial property of=
 binary matrices. A binary matrix has the COP, if there exists a permutatio=
n of columns that arranges the ones consecutively in all the rows. In the f=
i rst part of the talk, we will focus on testing the COP of a binary matrix=
. We will see that this problem is equivalent to fi nding a feasible interv=
al assignment to the set system associated with the binary matrix. We then =
present the intersection cardinality preserving interval assignment ( ICPIA=
 ) characterization of matrices with the COP. Also, we describe the details=
 of finding a feasible interval assignment to the set sys tem , if one exis=
ts. In the second part, we pose an optimization problem (Min- ICPIA ) relat=
ed to the ICPIA characterization and show that this problem is equivalent t=
o the classical Vertex Cover problem. Finally, we consider the Consecutive =
Ones Submatrix (COS) problem to deal with matrices that do not have the COP=
. Given a binary matrix M and a positive integer d, COS by row deletion is =
to decide whether there exists a set of at most d-rows of M whose deletion =
results in a matrix with the COP. We show that COS problem is fixed-paramet=
er tractable ( FPT ) with d as the parameter. We establish this via the FPT=
 algorithm for Interval Deletion problem.=20
