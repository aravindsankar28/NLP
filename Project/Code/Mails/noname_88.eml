Title: On the Approximability of the Maximum Acyclic Subgraph problem=20

Abstract: Suppose we want to rank a group of chess players based on a=20
collection of matches played between a pair of players. A natural=20
objective is to maximize the fraction of matches in the collection=20
whose outcome was consistent with the ranking --- the winner is the=20
higher ranked player.=20

This is exactly the Maximum Acyclic Subgraph problem and has been=20
extensively studied in the purview of approximation algorithms.=20
Despite much effort, the best algorithm known satisfies only a half of=20
the matches played. On the other hand, even a random ranking of the=20
players is consistent with half the matches in expectation. In this=20
talk, I will describe why it may be NP-hard to beat the guarantees of=20
the random ranking algorithm.=20

This talk is based on work with my collaborators: Moses Charikar,=20
Venkatesan Guruswami, Johan H=C3=A5stad, and Prasad Raghavendra.=20
