Topic: On Buffer Dimensioning of DTN Routing Nodes Using Large Deviations
Theory.
Venue: BSB 361, Dept. of CSE.

Abstract:

The Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTNs) have been envisaged to provide
connectivity in disrupted environments. Unlike conventional wireless
networks such as Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs), that operate with
store-and-forward paradigm; wherein the corresponding source-destination
nodes are assumed to be connected (either via single-hop, or via multi-hop
with the help of the other nodes) during the time of the message transfer,
until its delivery.  In contrast, DTNs consider store, carry, and forward
paradigm wherein the nodes physically carry messages either to the
destination node or any other potential node (called relay node) that can
carry them further to the destination nodes. The nodes in the DTN are
generally mobile and wireless devices that are highly resource constrained.
The crux of the DTN routing architecture therefore lies in the physical
transportation of messages by these resource-bound nodes. This demands a
sufficient buffer space for a seamless functioning of the DTN routing
protocols. Buffer dimensioning is therefore essential to design a practical
and efficient DTN. While much of the existing literature on DTN routing
study assumes either infinite (or) finite buffer space at the nodes, a few
research works have studied the first order statistics (i.e., average) of
the buffer size and deal with scheduling policies to further improve the
routing performance. In our research work, we move a step further by
studying the tail distribution of the buffer size with the help of large
deviations theory. To this end, in our study, we propose buffer
dimensioning frameworks for two different DTN routing models that involve
single-hop network, and multi-hop replication-based networks. Our extensive
simulation results validate our analytical models, and also demonstrate the
routing performance of the proposed dimensioned buffer models to be
statistically equivalent to that of the infinite buffer models.

 ALL ARE WELCOME
