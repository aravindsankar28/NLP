Abstract: We address two problems: upper body human pose estimation in stil=
l images and multi-pedestrian tracking in outdoor videos. The key idea in b=
oth approaches is a method based on graph that aims to estimate the optimal=
 configuration from different components of its structure. These components=
 are: body parts in case of upper body pose estimation problem, and differe=
nt pedestrian bounding boxes in case of multi-pedestrian tracking problem.=

In the pose estimation problem, the goal is to detect and estimate 2D human=
 pose in static images for six parts: head, torso, and left-right upper and=
 lower arms. We formulate this as a graphical model inference problem consi=
dering body parts as vertices in the graph and we use the loopy belief prop=
agation algorithm for inference. When a human appears in fronto-parallel pl=
ane, fixed size part detectors are sufficient and give reliable detection. =
But when parts like lower and upper arms move out of image plane, we observ=
e foreshortening and the part detectors become erroneous. We propose an app=
roach that compensates foreshortening in upper and lower arms, and effectiv=
ely prunes the search state space of each part. Additionally, we introduce =
two extra pairwise constraints to exploit the color similarity information =
between parts during inference to get better localization of upper and lowe=
r arms. We present experiments and results on two challenging datasets show=
ing improvements on lower arms accuracy and comparable results for other pa=
rts.=20




In the multi-pedestrian tracking problem, the goal is to track multiple ped=
estrians simultaneously as they move in the video. We propose an online alg=
orithm for the same that exploits pedestrian velocities and performs tracki=
ng after dividing them into separate groups. We represent each group as a g=
raph, and compute the optimal tracking configuration for each group in ever=
y frame. Our algorithm is robust and it handles inter pedestrian occlusions=
 in crowded scenes. We also propose a method that performs automatic detect=
ion of new pedestrians parallel to tracking. We present experiments and res=
ults on two challenging datasets showing improvements in results over other=
 state of the art methods.=20
