Dear faculty members and students,

It is my pleasure to announce a talk by Prof. Krishna Palem of Rice Univers=
ity titled "A Decade of Building Broken Chips." The talk will be in CS 361 =
at 11AM on Thursday, July 25th. The abstract and biography of his talk are =
below (or you can see the attached Word document for a more well-formatted =
version).

Prof. Palem will be with us on July 24th (afternoon) and July 25th (all day=
 till ~4PM). I will arrange a time for a discussion with students (most lik=
ely July 25th afternoon) and announce details. Faculty members who would li=
ke to meet with Prof. Palem are requested to arrange a time with me via ema=
il.

Regards,
John.

A Decade of Building Broken Chips

Prof. Krishna V. Palem, Rice University


Abstract: Well over a decade ago, many believed that an engine of growth dr=
iving the semiconductor and computing industries, captured nicely by Gordon=
 Moore=E2=80=99s remarkable prophecy (Moore=E2=80=99s law), was speeding to=
wards a dangerous cliff-edge. Ranging from expression of concern to doomsda=
y scenarios, the exact time when serious hurdles would beset us varied quit=
e a bit=E2=80=94some of the more optimistic warnings giving Moore=E2=80=99s=
 law till 2020! Needless to say, a lot of people have spent time and effort=
 with great success to find ways for substantially extending the time when =
we would encounter the dreaded cliff-edge, if not avoid it altogether. When=
 faced with this issue, I decided to consider a different approach=E2=80=94=
one which suggested falling off the metaphorical cliff as a design choice, =
but in a controlled manner. This would result in devices that could switch =
and produce bits that are correct, namely have the intended value, only wit=
h a probabilistic guarantee. As a result, the results could in fact be inco=
rrect. Such devices and associated circuits and computing structures are no=
w broadly referred to as inexact designs, circuits and architectures. In th=
is talk, I will start with the beginnings of this idea in 2002=E2=80=94one =
that Technology Review labeled as being heretical in their TR10 citation=E2=
=80=94and give an overview of a range of ideas that my students and other g=
roups around the world have been developing since, that embody inexact comp=
uting today. Despite being probabilistic, inexact designs can be significan=
tly more efficient in the energy they consume, their speed of execution and=
 area needs, which makes them attractive for resilient applications which c=
an tolerate error. I will also contrast this style of design with tradition=
al approaches with a rich history, aimed at realizing reliable computing fr=
om unreliable elements, starting with von Neumann=E2=80=99s influential lec=
tures and further developed elegantly by Shannon-Weaver and others.


Bio:
Krishna V. Palem is the Ken and Audrey Kennedy Professor at Rice University=
 with appointments in Computer Science, in Electrical and Computer Engineer=
ing and in Statistics. He founded and directed the NTU-Rice Institute on Su=
stainable and Applied Infodynamics (ISAID), and is a scholar in the Baker I=
nstitute for Public Policy. Concurrently, he was a Nanyang Visiting Profess=
or in the School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at the Nanyang Techn=
ological University (NTU), Singapore. He was a Moore Distinguished Faculty =
Fellow at Caltech in 2006-2007, and a Schonbrunn Fellow at the Hebrew Unive=
rsity of Jerusalem in 1999, where he was recognized for excellence in teach=
ing. His advisee Suren Talla was awarded the Janet Fabri Prize for outstand=
ing dissertation in 2001, and his related work on the foundations of archit=
ecture assembly for designing reconfigurable embedded SoC architectures, de=
veloped at Proceler Inc. which he co-founded and served as a CTO, was a nom=
inee for the Analysts Choice Awards as one of the (four) outstanding techno=
logies of 2002.

More recently, he has pioneered a novel technology entitled Probabilistic C=
MOS (PCMOS) for enabling ultra low-energy embedded computing, with his stud=
ents. In this context, his student Lakshmi Chakrapani's research was recogn=
ized through an outstanding dissertation award by Sigma Xi in 2008. PCMOS h=
as also been recognized by a best-paper award at the IEEE-ACM CASES 2006 co=
nference in Seoul, as one of the ten technologies 'likely to change the way=
 we live' by MIT's Technology Review, and as one of the seven 'emerging wor=
ld changing technologies' by IEEE as part of its 125th anniversary celebrat=
ions. Broadly, he has led efforts internationally in the area of embedded s=
ystems and their compiler optimizations, for which he has been named a Fell=
ow of the IEEE, the ACM and AAAS. In 2012, Forbes (India) ranked him second=
 on the list of eighteen scientists who are ``...some of the finest minds o=
f Indian origin.=E2=80=9D He is the recipient of the 2008 W. Wallace McDowe=
ll Award, IEEE Computer Society's highest technical award and one of comput=
ing's most prestigious individual honors.
