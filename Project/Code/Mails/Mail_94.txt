Provable Security is an approach to provide evidence of security by means o=
f reduction. If the cryptosystem can be broken in some specific way, then i=
t would be possible to efficiently solve some well-studied problem that is =
thought to be difficult. The problems normally used are factoring problem, =
discrete logarithm problem, computational Diffie-Hellman problem and so on.=
 The security notions widely used in the provably secure approach for the e=
ncryption schemes are derived from the subset of the cross product of the g=
oal to be achieved and the attack model. The goal belongs to the set invert=
ibility(INV), indistinguishability(IND) and non malleablity(NM). The attack=
 models fall into CPA (Chosen Plain Text attack) and CCA (Chosen Cipher Tex=
t attack). When quantum computer comes into existence the aforementioned pr=
oblems can be solved. So the research goes on searching the problems that c=
annot be solved by quantum computer. The areas found out so far are Lattice=
 based, Code based, Hash based and Multivariate based cryptosystems. The cr=
yptography based on the said areas is termed as Post quantum cryptography. =
Investigating the security notions of first code based cryptoystem namely M=
cEliece, it is found to be one way function. So to obtain the higher notion=
s of security, modifications on the original scheme are proposed in the lit=
erature. The security can be proved either in the random oracle model or in=
 the standard model, of which standard model is generally prefered. The exi=
sting CCA2 secure McEliece in the standard model consists of =CE=BA repetit=
ion encryption, and hence there is large overhead in terms of public key si=
ze and cipher text components. We proposed an efficient design of IND-CCA2 =
secure McEliece cryptosystem without =CE=BA repetition in the standard mode=
