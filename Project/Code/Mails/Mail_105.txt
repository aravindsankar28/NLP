Abstract:=20

Automatic detection and correction of grammatical errors in a morphological=
ly rich and free word order language like Bangla is a non trivial task. The=
 problem is to automatically detect and correct errors in an ungrammatical =
Bangla sentence having postpositional and nominal inflectional errors. A me=
thodology needs to be devised for correcting the mistakes committed by user=
s and also to provide relevant examples for supporting the suggested correc=
tion. To have an idea on how strongly we can rely on such a correction, it =
will be useful to devise a measure of sentence complexity with respect to t=
he grammar correction task. If a sentence is complex, the user should not b=
e overtly reliant on the correction suggested by the system. Conversely if =
the complexity measure is low, the user can confidently choose the suggesti=
on.=20

A sufficiently large number of error corpus is essential for training and t=
esting of any grammar correction methodology. Manual collection of such hug=
e error corpora is a tedious and time consuming task. Therefore, a novel sy=
nthetic error corpora creation methodology has been proposed. This has been=
 done using a combination of confidence score estimator and mal-rule filter=
 to introduce errors into a corpus of correct text. A novel approach has be=
en proposed for automatic detection and correction of Bangla grammatical er=
rors using a Natural Language Generation (NLG) technique. Our NLG based gra=
mmar correction approach follows lemmatization, over generation, pruning of=
 search space and best path selection procedures. In order to ensure that t=
he suggested correction is not too divergent from the source erroneous sent=
ence, the WER and BLEU score have been used. The proposed approach also est=
imates the complexity of the grammar correction task so that the user can b=
e informed about the system=E2=80=99s confidence. An active learning based =
complexity estimation has been used to estimate the complexity of grammar c=
orrection. Evaluation of grammar correction system is one of the challenges=
 in this area of research. Performance of most of the available grammar che=
cker systems cannot be compared as different systems address different type=
s of errors. Moreover, systems are not tested on common data set. Testing o=
n a common data set is particularly problematic when different grammar chec=
kers are designed for different languages. To circumvent these problems, a =
Methodology for Evaluation of Grammar Assessment (MEGA) combining a Graded =
Acceptability Assessment Metric (GAAM) and a Complexity Measurement Metric =
(CMM) has been introduced.=20
